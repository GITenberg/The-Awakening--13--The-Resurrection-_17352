crowded in a small space, to disfigure the land on which
they lived; all the stone they covered it with to keep it
barren; how so diligently every sprouting blade of grass
was removed; all the smoke of coal and naphtha; all the
cutting down of trees and driving off of cattle could not
shut out the spring, even from the city. The sun was
shedding its light; the grass, revivified, was blooming
forth, where it was left uncut, not only on the greenswards
of the boulevard, but between the flag-stones, and
the birches, poplars and wild-berry trees were unfolding
their viscous leaves; the limes were unfolding their buds;
the daws, sparrows and pigeons were joyfully making
their customary nests, and the flies were buzzing on the
sun-warmed walls. Plants, birds, insects and children
were equally joyful. Only men&mdash;grown-up men&mdash;continued
cheating and tormenting themselves and each other.
People saw nothing holy in this spring morning, in
this beauty of God's world&mdash;a gift to all living creatures&mdash;inclining
to peace, good-will and love, but worshiped
their own inventions for imposing their will on each
other.</p>

<p>The joy of spring felt by animals and men did not penetrate
the office of the county jail, but the one thing of
supreme importance there was a document received the
previous evening, with title, number and seal, which ordered
the bringing into court for trial, this 28th day of
April, at nine o'clock in the morning, three prisoners&mdash;two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>women and one man. One of the women, as the
more dangerous criminal, was to be brought separately.
So, in pursuance of that order, on the 28th day of April,
at eight o'clock in the morning, the jail warden entered
the dingy corridor of the woman's ward. Immediately
behind him came a woman with weary countenance and
disheveled gray hair, wearing a crown-laced jacket, and
girdled with a blue-edged sash. She was the matron.</p>

<p>"You want Maslova?" she asked the warden, as they
neared one of the cells opening into the corridor.</p>

<p>The warden, with a loud clanking of iron, unlocked
and opened the door of the cell, releasing an even fouler
odor than permeated the corridor, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Maslova to the court!" and again closing the door he
waited for her appearance.</p>

<p>The fresh, vivifying air of the fields, carried to the city
by the wind, filled even the court-yard of the jail. But
in the corridor the oppressive air, laden with the smell
of tar and putrescence, saddened and dejected the spirit
of every new-comer. The same feeling was experienced
by the jail matron, notwithstanding she was accustomed
to bad air. On entering the corridor she suddenly felt a
weariness coming over her that inclined her to slumber.</p>

<p>There was a bustling in the cell; women's voices and
steps of bare feet were heard.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Maslova! Come on, I say!" shouted the
warden into the cell-door.</p>

<p>Presently at the cell-door appeared a middle-sized, full-breasted
young woman, dressed in a long, gray coat over a
white waist and skirt. She approached with firm step,
and, facing about, stood before the warden. Over her
linen stockings she wore jail shoes; her head was covered
with a white 'kerchief, from under which black curls were
evidently purposely brushed over the forehead. The face
of the woman was of that whiteness peculiar to people
who have been a long time in confinement, and which reminds
one of potato-sprouts in a cellar. Her small, wide
hands, her white, full neck, showing from under the large
collar of the coat, were of a similar hue. On the dull pallor
of that face the most striking feature was the black,
sparkling eyes, somewhat swollen, but very bright eyes,
one of which slightly squinted. She held herself erect,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>putting forth her full chest. Emerging into the corridor,
throwing her head back a little, she looked into the eyes
of the warden and stood ready to do his bidding. The
warden was about to shut the door, when a pale, severe,
wrinkled face of an old woman with disheveled hair was
thrust out. The old woman began to say something to
Maslova. But the warden pressed the door against the
head of the woman, and she disappeared. In the cell a
woman's voice burst into laughter. Maslova also smiled,
and turned to the grated little opening in the door. The
old woman pressed her forehead to the grating, and said
in a hoarse voice:</p>

<p>"Above all, don't speak too much; stick to one thing,
and that is all."</p>

<p>"Of course. It cannot be any worse," said Maslova.</p>

<p>"You certainly cannot stick to two things," said the
chief warden, with official assurance of his own wit. "Follow
me, now! Forward! March!"</p>

<p>The eye looking from behind the grating disappeared,
and Maslova took to the middle of the corridor, and with
short, but rapid strides, followed the warden. They descended
the stone stairway, and as they passed the men's
ward, noisy and more noisome even than the woman's
ward, scores of eyes followed them from behind the gratings.
They entered the office, where an armed escort of
two soldiers stood. The clerk handed one of the soldiers
a document, reeking of tobacco smoke, and, pointing to
the prisoner, said:</p>

<p>"Take her."</p>

<p>The soldier, a Nijhni peasant with a red and pock-marked
face, placed the paper into the cuff of his coat
sleeve, and, smiling, winked to his muscular comrade.
The soldiers and prisoner descended the stairs and went
in the direction of the main entrance.</p>

<p>A small door in the gate opened, and, crossing the
threshold, they passed through the inclosure and took the
middle of the paved street.</p>

<p>Drivers, shop-keepers, kitchen maids, laborers and officials
halted and gazed with curiosity at the prisoner.
Some shook their heads and thought: "There is the result
of evil conduct&mdash;how unlike ours!" Children looked
with horror at the cut-throat, but the presence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>soldiers reassured them, for she was now powerless to do
harm. A villager, returning from the mart, where he
had disposed of his charcoal and visited an inn, offered
her a kopeck. The prisoner blushed, drooped her head
and murmured something.</p>

<p>Conscious of the attention that was shown her, without
turning her head she looked askance at the onlookers
and rather enjoyed it. She also enjoyed the comparatively
pure spring air, but the walking on the cobblestones
was painful to her feet, unused as they were to
walking, and shod in clumsy prison shoes. She looked
at her feet and endeavored to step as lightly as possible.
Passing by a food store, in front of which some pigeons
were picking grain, she came near striking with her foot
a dove-colored bird. It rose with a flutter of its wings,
and flew past the very ear of the prisoner, fanning her
face with its wings. She smiled, then sighed deeply, remembering
her own condition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>The history of the prisoner Maslova was a very common
one. Maslova was the daughter of an unmarried
menial who lived with her mother, a cowherd, on the
estate of two spinsters. This unmarried woman gave
birth to a child every year, and, as is the custom in the
villages, baptized them; then neglected the troublesome
newcomers, and they finally starved to death.</p>

<p>Thus five children died. Every one of these was baptized,
then it starved and finally died. The sixth child,
begotten of a passing gypsy, was a girl, who would have
shared the same fate, but it happened that one of the two
old maidens entered the cow-shed to reprimand the milkmaids
for carelessness in skimming the cream, and there
saw the mother with the healthy and beautiful child.
The old maiden chided them for the cream and for permitting
the woman to lie in the cow-shed, and was on
the point of departing, but noticing the child, was moved
to pity, and afterward consented to stand godmother
to the child. She baptized the child, and in pity for her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>god-daughter, furnished her with milk, gave the mother
some money, and the babe thrived. Wherefore the old
maidens called it "the saved one."</p>

<p>The child was three years old when the mother fell ill
and died. She was a great burden to her grandmother,
so the old maidens adopted her. The dark-eyed girl
became unusually lively and pretty, and her presence
cheered them.</p>

<p>Of the two old maidens, the younger one&mdash;Sophia
Ivanovna&mdash;was the kindlier, while the older one&mdash;Maria
Ivanovna&mdash;was of austere disposition. Sophia Ivanovna
kept the girl in decent clothes, taught her to read and intended
to give her an education. Maria Ivanovna said
that the girl ought to be taught to work that she might
become a useful servant, was exacting, punished, and
even beat her when in bad humor. Under such conditions
the girl grew up half servant, half lady. Her position
was reflected even in her name, for she was not
called by the gentle Katinka, nor yet by the disdainful
Katka, but Katiousha, which stands sentimentally between
the two. She sewed, cleaned the rooms, cleaned
the ikons with chalk, ground, cooked and served coffee,
washed, and sometimes she read for the ladies.</p>

<p>She was wooed, but would marry no one, feeling that
life with any one of her wooers would be hard, spoiled, as
she was, more or less, by the comparative ease she enjoyed
in the manor.</p>

<p>She had just passed her sixteenth year when the ladies
were visited by their nephew, a rich student, and Katiousha,
without daring to confess it to him, or even to herself,
fell in love with him. Two years afterward, while
on his way to the war, he again visited his aunts, and
during his four days' stay, consummated her ruin. Before
his departure he thrust a hundred ruble bill into her
hand.</p>

<p>Thenceforward life ceased to have any charms for her,
and her only thought was to escape the shame which
awaited her, and not only did she become lax in her
duties, but&mdash;and she did not know herself how it happened&mdash;all
of a sudden she gave vent to her ill temper.
She said some rude things to the ladies, of which she
afterward repented, and left them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Dissatisfied with her behavior, they did not detain her.
She then obtained employment as servant in the house of
the commissary of rural police, but was obliged to give
up the position at the end of the third month, for the
commissary, a fifty-year old man, pursued her with his
attentions, and when, on one occasion, he became too
persistent, she flared up, called him an old fool, and
threw him to the ground. Then she was driven from the
house. She was now so far advanced on the road to maternity
that to look for a position was out of the question.
Hence she took lodgings with an old midwife, who was
also a wine dealer. The confinement came off painlessly.
But the midwife was attending a sick woman in the village,
infected Katiousha with puerperal fever, and the
child, a boy, was taken to a foundling asylum where, she
was told, he died immediately after his arrival there.</p>

<p>When Katiousha took lodgings with the midwife she
had 127 rubles; 27 rubles of which she had earned, and
100 rubles which had been given her by her seducer.
When she left her she had but six rubles left. She was
not economical, and spent on herself as well as others.
She paid 40 rubles to the midwife for two months' board;
25 rubles it cost her to have the child taken away; 40
rubles the midwife borrowed of her to buy a cow with;
the balance was spent on dresses, presents, etc., so that
after the confinement she was practically penniless, and
was compelled to look for a position. She was soon installed
in the house of a forester who was married, and
who, like the commissary, began to pay court to her.
His wife became aware of it, and when, on one occasion,
she found them both in the room, she fell on Katiousha
and began to beat her. The latter resented it, and the
result was a scrimmage, after which she was driven out
of the house, without being paid the wages due her.
Katiousha went to the city, where she stopped with her
aunt. Her aunt's husband was a bookbinder. Formerly
he used to earn a competence, but had lost his
customers, and was now given to drink, spending everything
that came into his hands.</p>

<p>With the aid of a small laundry she was keeping, her
aunt supported her children as well as her husband. She
offered Maslova work as a washerwoman, but seeing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>what a hard life the washerwomen at her aunt's establishment
were leading, she searched through the intelligence
offices for a position as servant. She found such a place
with a lady who was living with her two student boys.
A week after she had entered upon her duties, the oldest
son neglected his studies and made life miserable for
Maslova. The mother threw all blame upon Maslova
and discharged her. She was some time without any
occupation. In one of these intelligence offices she once
met a lady richly dressed and adorned with diamonds.
This lady, learning of the condition of Maslova, who was
looking for a position, gave her her card and invited her
to call. The lady received Maslova affectionately, treated
her to choice cakes and sweet wine, while she dispatched
her servant somewhere with a note. In the evening a
tall man with long hair just turning gray, and gray beard,
came into the room. The old man immediately seated
himself beside Maslova and began to jest. The hostess
called him into an adjoining room, and Maslova overheard
her say: "As fresh as a rose; just from the country."
Then the hostess called in Maslova and told her that the
man was an author, very rich, <i>and will be very generous
if he takes a liking to her</i>. He did take a liking to her,
gave her twenty-five rubles, and promised to call on her
often. The money was soon spent in settling for her
board at her aunt's, for a new dress, hat and ribbons. A
few days afterward the author sent for her a second time.
She called. He gave her another twenty-five ruble bill
and offered to rent apartments for her where she could
reside separately.</p>

<p>While living in the apartments rented by the author,
Maslova became infatuated with a jolly clerk living in
the same house. She herself told the author of her infatuation,
and moved into a smaller apartment. The
clerk, who had promised to marry her, without saying
anything, left for Nijhni, evidently casting her off, and
Maslova remained alone. She wished to remain in the
apartment, but the landlord would not permit a single
woman to occupy it, and she returned to her aunt. Her
fashionable dress, cape and hat won her the respect of her
aunt, who no longer dared to offer her work as a washerwoman,
considering her present position far above it.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>The question of working in the laundry did not even
occur to Maslova now. She looked with compassion on
the life of drudgery led by these pale, emaciated washerwomen,
some of whom showed symptoms of consumption,
washing and ironing in a stifling, steam-laden atmosphere
with the windows open summer and winter,
and she was horrified at the thought that she, too, might
be driven to such drudgery.</p>

<p>Maslova had for a long time been addicted to cigarette
smoking, but of late she had been getting more and
more accustomed to drink. The wine attracted her, not
because of its taste, but because it enabled her to forget
her past life, to comfort herself with ease, and the confidence
of her own worth that it gave her. Without wine
she was despondent and abashed. There was the choice
of two things before her; either the humiliating occupation
of a servant, with the certain unwelcome attentions
of the men, or a secure, quiet and legitimatized position
of everybody's mistress. She wished to revenge herself
on her seducer, as well as the clerk, and all those that
brought misfortune upon her. Besides, she could not
withstand the temptation of having all the dresses her
heart desired&mdash;dresses made of velvet, gauze and silk&mdash;ball
dresses, with open neck and short sleeves. And
when Maslova imagined herself in a bright yellow silk
dress, with velvet trimmings, decolette, she made her
choice.</p>

<p>From this day on Maslova began to lead a life to
which hundreds of thousands of women are driven, and
which, in nine cases out of ten, ends in painful disease,
premature decrepitude and death.</p>

<p>After a night's orgies there would come a deep slumber
till three or four o'clock in the afternoon; then the weary
rising from a dirty couch; seltzer-water to remove the
effect of excessive drinking, coffee. Then came the
sauntering through the rooms in dressing-gown, looking
through the windows; the languid quarrels; then the perfuming
of her body and hair, the trying on of dresses, and
the quarrels with the mistress which they occasioned;
contemplating herself in the mirror, rouging her face,
darkening her eyebrows. Then came the sweet, rich
food, the bright silk dress, the entry into the brightly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>lighted parlor, the arrival of the guests, music, dancing,
confectionery, wine and cigarettes.</p>

<p>Thus Maslova lived for seven years. On the eighth,
when she had reached her twenty-sixth year, there happened
that for which she had been jailed, and for which
she was now led to the court, after six months of confinement
among thieves and murderers.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>At the time when Maslova, exhausted by the long
walk, was approaching with the armed convoy the building
in which court was held, the same nephew of the
ladies that brought her up, Prince Dmitri Ivanovitch
Nekhludoff, who deceived her, lay on his high, soft,
spring feather-bed, in spotless Holland linen, smoking a
cigarette. He was gazing before him, contemplating
the events of the previous day and considering what he
had before him for that day. As he thought of the previous
evening, spent at the Korchagins, a wealthy and
influential family, whose daughter, rumor had it, he was
to marry, he sighed, and throwing away the butt of his
cigarette, he was on the point of taking another from the
silver cigarette holder, but changed his mind. Half rising,
he slipped his smooth, white feet into the slippers,
threw a silk morning gown over his broad shoulders, and
with quick and heavy stride, walked into the adjoining
dressing-room, which was permeated with the artificial
odors of elixirs, perfumes, cosmetics. There he washed
his partly gold-filled teeth with a tooth-powder, rinsed
them with a perfumed mouth-wash, then began to sponge
himself and dry his body with Turkish towels. After
washing his hands with perfumed soap, carefully brushing
his trimmed nails and washing his face and stout neck
in a marble basin, he walked into a third room, where a
shower-bath was ready. Here he received a cold-water
douche, and after rubbing his white and muscular body
with coarse towels and donning his white linen, he seated
himself before the mirror and began to brush his short,
curly beard and the thinning curls of his forehead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Everything used by him&mdash;the linen, clothing, shoes,
scarfs, scarf-pins, cuff-buttons, were of the very best
quality, simple, tasteful and expensive.</p>

<p>He then picked out the first of a dozen scarfs and pins
that came into his hand&mdash;it was no more novel and amusing,
as it used to be&mdash;and he was quite indifferent as to
which he put on. He dressed himself in his brushed
clothes which lay on the chair and went out, though not
quite refreshed, yet clean and fragrant. In the oblong
dining-room, the inlaid floor of which had been
polished by three of his men the day before, and containing
a massive oaken sideboard and a similar extension
table, the legs of which were carved in the shape of
lion's paws, giving it a pompous appearance, breakfast
stood ready for him. A fine, starched cloth with large
monograms was spread on the table, on which stood a
silver coffee-pot, containing fragrant, steaming coffee, a
sugar bowl and cream pitcher to match, fresh rolls and
various kinds of biscuits. Beside them lay the last number
of the "Revue des deux Mondes," newspapers and
his mail. Nekhludoff was about to open the letters,
when a middle-aged woman, with a lace head-gear over
her unevenly parted hair, glided into the room. This
was Agrippina Petrovna, servant of his mother, who
died in this very house. She was now stewardess to the
son.</p>

<p>Agrippina Petrovna had traveled many years abroad
with Nekhludoff's mother, and had acquired the manners
of a lady. She had lived in the house of the Nekhludoffs
since childhood, and knew Dmitri Ivanovitch when he
was called by the diminutive Mitenka.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Dmitri Ivanovitch."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Agrippina Petrovna? What's the
news?" asked Nekhludoff, jesting.</p>

<p>"A letter from the old Princess, or the young one,
perhaps. The maid brought it long ago, and is now
waiting in my room," said Agrippina Petrovna, handing
him the letter with a significant smile.</p>

<p>"Very well; I will attend to it immediately," said Nekhludoff,
taking the letter and then, noticing the smile on
Agrippina's face, he frowned.</p>

<p>The smile on Agrippina's face signified that the letter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>came from Princess Korchagin, whom, according to
Agrippina Petrovna, he was to marry. And this supposition,
expressed by her smile, displeased Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Then I will bid her wait," and Agrippina <a name="Petrovna" id="Petrovna"></a>Petrovna
glided out of the dining-room, first replacing the crumb-brush,
which lay on the table, in its holder.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff opened the perfumed letter and began to
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In fulfillment of the duty I assumed of being your
memory," the letter ran, "I call to your mind that you
have been summoned to serve as juror to-day, the 28th
of April, and that, therefore, you cannot accompany us
and Kolosoff to the art exhibition, as you promised yesterday
in your customary forgetfulness; &agrave; moins que
vous ne soyez dispos&eacute; &agrave; payer &agrave; la cour d'assises les 300
rubles d'amende que vous vous refusez pour votre
cheval, for your failure to appear in time. I remembered
it yesterday, when you had left. So keep it in
mind.</p>

<p class="citation">"<span class="smcap">Princess M. Korchagin</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>On the other side was a postscript:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Maman vous fait dire que votre couvert vous attendra
jusqu' &agrave; la nuit. Venez absolument &agrave; quelle
heure que cela soit. M.&nbsp;K."</p></div>

<p>Nekhludoff knit his brows. The note was the continuation
of a skillful strategem whereby the Princess
sought, for the last two months, to fasten him with invisible
bonds. But Nekhludoff, besides the usual irresoluteness
before marriage of people of his age, and who
are not passionately in love, had an important reason for
withholding his offer of marriage for the time being.
The reason was not that ten years before he had ruined
and abandoned Katiousha, which incident he had entirely
forgotten, but that at this very time he was sustaining relations
with a married woman, and though he now considered
them at an end, they were not so considered by
her.</p>

<p>In the presence of women, Nekhludoff was very shy,
but it was this very shyness that determined the married
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>woman to conquer him. This woman was the wife of
the commander of the district in which Nekhludoff was
one of the electors. She led him into relations with her
which held him fast, and at the same time grew more
and more repulsive to him. At first Nekhludoff could
not resist her wiles, then, feeling himself at fault, he
could not break off the relations against her will. This
was the reason why Nekhludoff considered that he had
no right, even if he desired, to ask for the hand of Korchagin.
A letter from the husband of that woman happened
to lay on the table. Recognizing the handwriting
and the stamp, Nekhludoff flushed and immediately felt
an influx of that energy which he always experienced in
the face of danger. But there was no cause for his agitation;
the husband, as commander of the district where
Nekhludoff's estates were situated, informed the latter of
a special meeting of the local governing body, and asked
him to be present without fail, and donner un coup
d'&eacute;paule in the important measures to be submitted concerning
the schools and roads, and that the reactionary
party was expected to offer strong opposition.</p>

<p>The commander was a liberal-minded man, entirely
absorbed with the struggles, and knew nothing about his
wretched family life.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff recalled all the tortures this man had occasioned
him; how on one occasion he thought that the
husband had discovered all, and he was preparing to
fight a duel with him, intending to use a blank cartridge,
and the ensuing scene where she, in despair, ran to the
pond, intending to drown herself, while he ran to search
for her. "I cannot go now, and can undertake nothing
until I have heard from her," thought Nekhludoff. The
preceding week he had written to her a decisive letter,
acknowledging his guilt, and expressing his readiness to
redeem it in any manner she should suggest, but for her
own good, considered their relations ended. It is to this
letter that he expected a reply. He considered it a favorable
sign that no reply came. If she had not consented
to a separation, she would have answered long
ago, or would have come personally, as she often did before.
Nekhludoff had heard that an army officer was
courting her, and while he was tormented by jealousy, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>was at the same time gladdened by the hope of release
from the oppressive lie.</p>

<p>The other letter was from the steward in charge of his
estates. Nekhludoff was requested to return and establish
his right to the inheritance and also to decide on
the future management of the estates; whether the same
system of letting out to the peasants, which prevailed
during the lifetime of his mother, was to be continued,
or, as the steward had strongly advised the deceased
Princess, and now advised the young Prince, to augment
the stock and work all the land himself. The steward
wrote that the land could thus best be exploited. He
also apologized for his failure to send the three thousand
rubles due on the first of the month, which he would
send by the next mail, explaining it by the difficulty of
collecting the rents from the peasants whose bad faith
had reached a point where it became necessary to resort
to the courts to collect them. This letter was partly
agreeable and partly disagreeable to Nekhludoff. It was
agreeable to feel the power of authority over so vast an
estate, and it was disagreeable, because in his youth he
was an enthusiastic adherent of Herbert Spencer, and
being himself a large land owner, was struck by the proposition
in <i>Social Statics</i> that private ownership of land
is contrary to the dictates of justice. With the frankness
and boldness of youth, he not only <i>then</i> spoke of the injustice
of private ownership of land; not only did he compose
theses in the university on the subject, but he actually
distributed among the peasants the few hundred
acres of land left him by his father, not desiring to own
land contrary to his convictions. Now that he found
himself the owner of vast estates, he was confronted by
two alternatives: either to waive his ownership in favor of
the peasants, as he did ten years ago with the two hundred
acres, or, by tacit acquiescence, confess that all his
former ideas were erroneous and false.</p>

<p>He could not carry out the first, because he possessed
no resources outside of the land. He did not wish to
go into service, and yet he had luxurious habits of life
which he thought he could not abandon. Indeed, there
was no necessity of abandoning these habits, since he
had lost the strength of conviction as well as the resolution,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>the vanity and the desire to astonish people that he
had possessed in his youth. The other alternative&mdash;to
reject all the arguments against private ownership of
land which he gathered from Spencer's <i>Social Statics</i>,
and of which he found confirmation in the works of
Henry George&mdash;he could follow even less.</p>

<p>For this reason the steward's letter was disagreeable
to him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>Having breakfasted, Nekhludoff went to the cabinet to
see for what hour he was summoned to appear at court,
and to answer the Princess' note. In the work-room
stood an easel with a half-finished painting turned face
downward, and on the wall hung studies in drawing. On
seeing that painting, on which he had worked two years,
and those drawings, he called to mind the feeling of impotence,
which he experienced of late with greatest force,
to make further advance in the art. He explained this
feeling by the development of a fine aesthetic taste, and yet
this consciousness caused him unpleasant sensations.</p>

<p>Seven years before he had retired from active service
he decided that his true vocation in life was painting, and
from the height of his artistic activity he looked down
upon all other occupations. And now it appeared that he
had no right to do so, and every recollection of it was disagreeable
to him. He looked on all the luxurious appointments
of the work-room with heavy heart, and walked
into the cabinet in ill humor. The cabinet was a high
room, profusely ornamented, and containing every imaginable
device of comfort and necessity.</p>

<p>He produced from one of the drawers of a large table
the summons, and, ascertaining that he must appear at
eleven o'clock, he sat down and wrote to the Princess,
thanking her for the invitation, and saying that he should
try to call for dinner. The tone of the note seemed to him
too intimate, and he tore it up; he wrote another, but that
was too formal, almost offensive. Again he tore it up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>and touched a button on the wall. A servant, morose,
with flowing side-whiskers and in a gray apron, entered.</p>

<p>"Please send for a carriage."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And tell the Korchagins' maid that I thank them; I will
try to call."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"It is impolite, but I cannot write. But I will see her
to-day," thought Nekhludoff, and started to dress himself.</p>

<p>When he emerged from the house a carriage with rubber
tires awaited him.</p>

<p>"You had scarcely left Prince Korchagin's house yesterday
when I called for you," said the driver, half-turning
his stout, sun-burned neck in the white collar of his
shirt, "and the footman said that you had just gone."</p>

<p>"Even the drivers know of my relations to the Korchagins,"
thought Nekhludoff, and the unsolved question which
continually occupied his mind of late&mdash;whether or not he
ought to marry Princess Korchagin&mdash;again occurred to
him, and, like most questions that he was called upon to
decide at that time, it remained unsolved.</p>

<p>He had many reasons for, and as many against, marriage.
There was the pleasure of domestic life, which
made it possible to lead a moral life, as he called married
life; then, and principally, the family and children would
infuse his present aimless life with a purpose. This was
for marriage generally. On the other hand there was,
first, the loss of freedom which all elderly bachelors fear
so much; and, second, an unconscious awe of that mysterious
creature, woman.</p>

<p>However, in favor of marrying Missy in particular
(Korchagin's name was Maria, but, as usual in families
of the higher classes, she received a nickname) there was,
first, the fact that she came of good stock, and was in
everything, from her dress to her manner of speaking,
walking and laughing, distinguished not by any exceptional
qualities, but by "good breeding"&mdash;he knew no other
expression for the quality which he prized very highly.
Second, she valued him above all other men, hence, he
thought she understood him. And this appreciation of
him, that is, acknowledging his high qualities, was proof
to Nekhludoff of her intelligence and correct judgment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Finally, against marrying Missy in particular, was, first,
the extreme probability of his finding a girl of much better
qualities than Missy, and, consequently, more worthy
of him; and, second, Missy was twenty-seven years old
and had probably loved other men before him. This
thought tormented him. His pride could not reconcile
itself to the thought that she could love some one else,
even in the past. Of course, she could not be expected to
know that she would meet him, but the very thought that
she could have loved some one else before offended him.</p>

<p>So that there were as many reasons for as there were
against marriage in general and marrying Missy in particular.
At all events the arguments were equally strong on
both sides, and Nekhludoff laughed as he compared himself
to the ass in the fable who, while deciding which of
the two bales of hay before him he should have his meal
from, starved himself.</p>

<p>"However, until I have heard from Maria Vasilieona,
the wife of the commander, and have done with her for
good, I can do nothing," he said to himself.</p>

<p>And the consciousness that he could and must defer his
decision pleased him.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I will consider it all later," he said to himself,
as his cabriolet silently approached the asphalt pavement
of the court-house.</p>

<p>"And now I must do my duty to the community conscientiously,
as I always do, and think it one's duty to do.
Besides, it is often interesting," he said, and went past the
door-keeper into the vestibule of the court.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>There was great commotion in the corridors of the
court when Nekhludoff entered.</p>

<p>The attendants flitted to and fro breathlessly, delivering
orders and documents. Police captains, lawyers and
clerks passed now one way, now the other; complainants
and defendants under bail leaned sadly against the walls,
or were sitting and waiting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"Where is the Circuit Court?" asked Nekhludoff of one
of the attendants.</p>

<p>"Which one? There is a civil division and a criminal
one."</p>

<p>"I am a juror."</p>

<p>"Criminal division. You should have said so. This
way, to the right, then turn to your left. The second
door."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff went as directed.</p>

<p>At the door two men stood waiting. One was a tall,
stout merchant, a good-natured man, who had evidently
partaken of some liquor and was in very high spirits; the
other was a clerk of Jewish extraction. They were talking
about the price of wool when Nekhludoff approached them
and asked if that was the jury's room.</p>

<p>"Here, sir, here. Are you also one of the jurymen?"
mirthfully winking his eyes, the good-natured merchant
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, we will drudge together, I suppose," he continued
in response to Nekhludoff's affirmative answer.
"My name is Baklashoff, merchant of the second guild,"
he introduced himself, extending his soft, broad hand; "we
must do our duty. Whom have I the honor of addressing?"</p>

<p>Nekhludoff gave his name and passed into the jury-room.</p>

<p>In the small jury-room there were about ten men of
every description. They had just arrived; some were sitting,
others walked about, eyeing, and making each other's
acquaintance. One was a retired officer in uniform; others
were in short coats, and but one in peasant garb.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that they were all complaining that
the jury duty was burdensome, and was taking them
away from their business, they all seemed to be pleased
with the consciousness of performing an important civic
duty.</p>

<p>The jurymen talked among themselves of the weather,
of the premature spring, of the business before them.
Those who were not acquainted with Nekhludoff hastened
to become so, evidently considering it an honor. And
Nekhludoff, as was usual with him among strangers, received
it as his due. If he were asked why he considered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>himself above the majority of people he would not be able
to answer, as there was nothing in his life transcending
the commonplace. The fact that he spoke English, French
and German fluently; that his linen, clothing, scarf and
cuff-buttons were of superior make would not be sufficient
reason for assuming his superiority, as he himself
well understood. And yet he doubtless acknowledged in
himself this superiority, and regarded the respect shown
him as his due, and was offended when it was not forthcoming.
It just happened that in the jury-room Nekhludoff
experienced this disagreeable feeling of being treated
with disrespect. Among the jurymen there was an acquaintance
of Nekhludoff. This was Peter Gerasimovitch
(Nekhludoff never knew, and even boasted of the
fact that he did not know his surname), who was at one
time tutor to his sister's children. Peter Gerasimovitch
was now teacher in a college. Nekhludoff could never
bear his familiarity, his self-satisfied laughter&mdash;in a word,
his "communizing," as Nekhludoff's sister used to put it.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! So you are also trapped?" he greeted Nekhludoff
with a loud burst of laughter. "You did not escape
it?"</p>

<p>"I never intended to evade my duty," sternly and gloomily
said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"That I call civic virtue. But wait till you are hungry
and sleepy, you will sing another tune," Peter Gerasimovitch
said, laughing still louder.</p>

<p>"This son of an archdeacon will soon begin to 'thou'
me," thought Nekhludoff, with an expression of sadness
on his face, as though he had just learned of a grievous
loss in his family. He turned from the ex-tutor and
approached a group of people that had formed around a
clean-faced, tall man, of dignified carriage, who were
holding a spirited conversation. The man was speaking of
a case that was being tried in the civil division, showing
his familiarity with the judges and the famous lawyers by
referring to them by name. He was telling them of the
remarkable turn given to the probable result of the case
by the dexterity of a famous lawyer, by which an old lady,
who was in the right, would be obliged to pay an enormous
sum to the adverse side.</p>

<p>"He is a most ingenious attorney," he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>He was listened to with respect, and some attempted to
interrupt him with some remarks, but he cut them short
as if he alone knew the true facts.</p>

<p>Although Nekhludoff arrived late, there was a long
wait before him, which was caused by the failure of one
of the judges to appear.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>The presiding justice arrived early. He was a tall, stout
man, with long, grayish side-whiskers. He was married,
but, like his wife, led a very dissolute life. They did not
interfere with each other. On the morning in question he
received a note from a Swiss governess, who had lived in
his house during the summer, and was now passing on her
way from the South to St. Petersburg. She wrote that
she would be in town between three and six o'clock p.&nbsp;m.,
and wait for him at the "Hotel Italia." He was, therefore,
anxious to end his day's sitting before six o'clock, that he
might meet the red-haired Clara Vasilievna.</p>

<p>Entering his private chamber, and locking the door behind
him, he produced from the lower shelf of a book-case
two dumb-bells, made twenty motions upward, forward,
sidewise and downward, and three times lowered himself,
holding the bells above his head.</p>

<p>"Nothing so refreshes one as a cold-water bath and exercise,"
he thought, feeling with his left hand, on the
fourth finger of which was a gold ring, the biceps of his
right arm. He had to go through two more movements
(these exercises he went through every day before court
opened), when the door rattled. Some one was attempting
to open it. The judge quickly replaced the dumb-bells
and opened the door.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said.</p>

<p>One of the members of the court, wearing gold eye-glasses,
of medium height, with high shoulders and frowning
countenance, entered.</p>

<p>"Matvei Nikitich is late again," said the newcomer, with
an air of displeasure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>"Yes," said the presiding judge, donning his robes.
"He is always late."</p>

<p>"It is a shame," said the member, and sat down angrily,
then lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>This member of the court, a very punctilious man, had
this morning had an unpleasant encounter with his wife,
which was caused by her spending her monthly allowance
before the month was up. She asked for a sum of money
in advance, and he refused. The result was a quarrel. She
said that unless he gave her the money there would be no
dinner that night, and that he would have to dine outside.
He departed in fear that she would carry out her threat,
as anything might be expected from her.</p>

<p>"Is it worth while leading a good, moral life?" he
thought, as he looked at the beaming, healthy, joyful and
good-natured presiding justice, who, spreading his elbows,
stroked his long, gray whiskers; "he is always contented
and cheerful, while I am suffering."</p>

<p>The secretary entered and handed the presiding justice
a document.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, and lighted a cigarette. "Which
case shall be taken up first?"</p>

<p>"The poison case, I think," the secretary answered, with
feigned indifference.</p>

<p>"Very well; so let it be the poison case," said the justice,
considering that that case could be disposed of by four
o'clock and make it possible for him to keep the appointment.
"Has Matvei Nikitich arrived?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Is Breae here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the secretary.</p>

<p>"Then tell him that we shall try the poisoning case."</p>

<p>Breae was an assistant prosecuting attorney and was assigned
to this term of the court.</p>

<p>The secretary met Breae in the corridor. With uplifted
shoulders, his robe unbuttoned, and portfolio under his
arm, he almost ran, his heels clattering on the floor, and
his disengaged hand outstretched in the direction in which
he was going.</p>

<p>"Michael Petrovich desires to know if you are ready,"
said the secretary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>"Certainly; I am always ready," said the assistant prosecutor;
"which is the first case?"</p>

<p>"The poisoning case."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the assistant prosecutor, but he did
not consider it well at all&mdash;he had not slept all night. A
send-off had been given to a departing friend, and he
drank and played till two in the morning, so that he was
entirely unfamiliar with this case, and now hastened to
glance over the indictment. The secretary had purposely
suggested the case, knowing that the prosecutor had not
read it. The secretary was a man of liberal, even radical,
ideas. Breae was conservative, and the secretary disliked
him, and envied his position.</p>

<p>"And what about the Skoptzy?"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>"I have already said that I cannot prosecute them in the
absence of witnesses," said the assistant prosecutor, "and
I will so declare to the court."</p>

<p>"But you don't need&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot," said the assistant prosecutor, and waving
his hand, ran to his office.</p>

<p>He was postponing the case against the Skoptzy, although
the <a name="absent" id="absent"></a>absent witness was an entirely unnecessary
one. The real reason of the postponement was that the
prosecutor feared that their trial before an intelligent jury
might end in their acquittal. By an understanding with
the presiding justice their case was to be transferred to
the session of the District Court, where the preponderance
of peasants on the jury would insure their conviction.</p>

<p>The commotion in the corridor increased. The greatest
crowd was before the Civil Court, where the case of which
the portly gentleman was telling the jurymen was being
tried. During a recess the same old lady from whom the
ingenious attorney managed to win her property in favor
of his shrewd client, came out of the court-room. That
he was not entitled to the property was known to the
judges as well as to the claimant and his attorney, but
the mode of their procedure was such that it was impossible
to dismiss their claim. The old lady was stout, in
smart attire, and with large flowers on her hat. As she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>passed into the corridor she stopped, and turning to her
lawyer, kept repeating:</p>

<p>"How can it be? Great heavens! I don't understand
it!"</p>

<p>The lawyer did not listen to her, but looked at the flowers
on her hat, making mental calculations.</p>

<p>Behind the old lady, beaming in his wide-open vest, and
with a self-sufficient smile on his face, came that same famous
lawyer who so managed the case that the lady
with the large flowers lost all her property, while his
shrewd client, who paid him ten thousand rubles, received
over a hundred thousand. All eyes were directed toward
him. He was conscious of it and seemed to say by his
demeanor:</p>

<p>"Never mind your expressions of devotion," and
brushed past the crowd.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Finally Matvei Nikitich arrived, and the usher, a long-necked
and lean man, with a sideling gait and protruding
lower lip, entered the jury-room.</p>

<p>The usher was an honest man, with a university education,
but he could not hold any employment on account of
his tippling habit. A countess, his wife's patroness, had
obtained him his present position three months ago; he
still retained it, and was exceedingly glad.</p>

<p>"Are you all here, gentlemen?" he asked, putting on his
pince-nez and looking through it.</p>

<p>"I think so," said the cheerful merchant.</p>

<p>"Let us see," said the usher, and drawing a sheet of
paper from his pocket, began to call the names of the jury,
looking at those that responded to their names now
through his pince-nez, now over it.</p>

<p>"Counsilor of State E.&nbsp;M. Nikiforoff."</p>

<p>"Here," said the portly gentleman, who was familiar
with all the litigations.</p>

<p>"Retired Colonel Ivan Semionovich Ivanoff."</p>

<p>"Present," answered a lank man in the uniform of a retired
officer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"Merchant of the second guild, Peter Baklashoff."</p>

<p>"Here," said the good-natured merchant, smiling from
ear to ear. "We are ready."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant of the Guards, Prince Dmitri Nekhludoff."</p>

<p>"Here," answered Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>The usher, looking politely and pleasantly through his
pince-nez, bowed, thereby distinguishing him from the
rest, as it were.</p>

<p>"Captain Uri Dmitrievich Danchenko; merchant Gregory
Ephimovich Kouleshoff," etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>There were but two missing from the panel.</p>

<p>"You will now, gentlemen, walk into the court," said
the usher, pointing to the door with a polite sweep of the
hand.</p>

<p>They all rose from their seats, and passing each other
through the door, made their way through the corridor to
the court-room.</p>

<p>The court was held in a large, oblong room. At one
end was a platform, reached by three steps. In the middle
of the platform stood a table, covered with green cloth,
which was fringed with a dark-green lace. Behind the
table stood three arm-chairs with high, carved backs. In
an image-case suspended in the right corner was a representation
of Christ with a crown of thorns, and beneath it
a reading-desk, and on the same side stood the prosecutor's
desk. To the left, opposite this desk, was the secretary's
table, and dividing these from the seats reserved for spectators
was a carved railing, along which stood the prisoners'
bench, as yet unoccupied.</p>

<p>On an elevation to the right were two rows of chairs,
also with high backs, reserved for the jury; below these
were tables for the attorneys. All this was in the front
part of the court-room, which was divided in two by a railing.
In the rear part of the room benches in lines extended
to the wall. In the front row sat four women, either
servants or factory employees, and two men, also workmen,
who were evidently awed by the grandeur of the ornamentations,
and were timidly whispering to each other.</p>

<p>Soon after the jurymen came the usher, who, walking
sidewise to the middle of the room, shouted, as if he meant
to frighten those present:</p>

<p>"The court is coming!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Everybody stood up, and the judges ascended the platform.
First came the presiding judge with his muscles
and beautiful whiskers. Then came the gold-spectacled,
gloomy member of the court&mdash;now even more gloomy, for
before the opening of the session he met his brother-in-law,
a candidate for a judicial office, who told him that he
had seen his sister, and that she declared that there would
be no dinner at home this day.</p>

<p>"So that, it seems, we will have to dine at an inn," said
the brother-in-law, laughing.</p>

<p>"What is there droll about it?" said the gloomy member
of the court, and sank into a still deeper gloom.</p>

<p>And last of all came the third member of the court, that
same Matvei Nikitich, who was always late. He wore a
long beard, and had large, kindly eyes, with drooping eyelids.
He suffered from catarrh of the stomach, and by
the advice of his physician had adopted a new regimen,
and this new regimen detained him this morning longer
than usual. When he ascended the platform he seemed
to be wrapped in thought, but only because he had the
habit of making riddles of every question that occurred to
him. At this moment he was occupied with the following
enigmatical proposition:</p>

<p>If the number of steps in the distance between the cabinet-door
and the arm-chair will divide by three without
a remainder, then the new regimen will cure him; but if
it does not so divide, then it will not. There were twenty-six
steps, but he made one short step and reached the
chair with the twenty-seventh.</p>

<p>As the judges ascended the elevation in their uniforms,
with gold-laced collars, they presented an imposing array.
They themselves felt it, and all three, as if confused by
their own greatness, modestly lowered their eyes, and
hastily seated themselves behind the table on which clean
paper and freshly-pointed lead pencils of all sizes had been
placed. The prosecutor, who entered with the judges, also
hastily walked to his place near the window, his portfolio
still under his arm, and waving his hand he began to read
the papers in the case, utilizing every moment to prepare
himself.</p>

<p>This was his fifth case as prosecuting attorney. He
was ambitious, and was determined to make his career,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>and hence he endeavored to obtain a conviction in every
case he prosecuted. He knew the main points of the poisoning
case, and had already planned his speech; but he
needed to know some particulars of which he was now
making extracts from the papers.</p>

<p>The secretary sat on the opposite side of the elevation,
and, having prepared all the papers that might be necessary
to produce on trial, was glancing over a newspaper
article, which he had obtained and read the day before.
He was anxious to talk to the member of the court with
the long beard, who shared his views, and before doing so
wished to better familiarize himself with it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>The presiding justice looked over the papers, asked
some questions of the usher, and receiving affirmative
answers, ordered that the prisoners be brought into
court. Immediately a door beyond the grating opened,
and two gendarmes with unsheathed swords and caps on
their heads, stepped into the court-room. Behind them
came a freckled, red-haired man and two women. The
man was dressed in prisoner's garb which was too long
and too wide for him. As he entered the court-room
he held up with outspread fingers the sleeves which were
too long. Without looking at the judges or the spectators,
his attention was absorbed by the bench around
which he was led. When he had passed around he carefully
seated himself on the edge, and making room for
the others, began to stare at the presiding justice, the
muscles of his cheeks moving as if he were whispering
something. He was followed by a middle-aged woman,
also dressed in a prisoner's coat. A white prison cap
covered her head; her face was grayish, and her eyes were
devoid of either eye-lashes or eyebrows. She seemed
quite composed. As she was passing the railing to take
her seat, her coat caught at something; without haste, she
carefully disengaged it, then smoothed it and took her
seat.</p>

<p>The third prisoner was Maslova.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>No sooner did she enter than all the male spectators
turned their eyes toward her, attracted by her white face,
lustrous black eyes and high breast. Even the gendarme
whom she passed gazed at her until she seated herself;
then, as if feeling himself guilty, he quickly turned his
head from her and straightening himself, he began to
gaze into the window directly in front of him.</p>

<p>The presiding justice waited until all the prisoners took
their places, and as soon as Maslova was seated, he
turned to the secretary.</p>

<p>Then commenced the customary proceeding; calling
of the jurymen, fining the absent ones, listening to the
claims of exemption from jury duty and filling the panel
from a number of reserves. Then the presiding justice
folded the slips of paper, placed them in a glass vase,
and turning up his gold-laced sleeve drew the slips one
by one, unrolled them and read them aloud. Then he
straightened his sleeve and called on the priest to swear
in the jury.</p>

<p>An old little priest with a swollen, pale yellow face,
in a brown cassock and gold cross on his breast and some
small badges pinned to the cassock, slowly moving his
swollen feet under the cassock, approached the reading
desk under the image.</p>

<p>The jury rose and, crowding each other, came forward.</p>

<p>"Come nearer, please," said the priest, touching with
his swollen hand the cross on his breast, and waiting
until all the jury were near him.</p>

<p>While the jury were mounting the steps to the elevation
where the desk stood, the priest wriggled his bald,
hoary head through the opening of the stole, then rearranging
his scanty hair, he turned to the jury:</p>

<p>"Raise your right hands and keep your fingers thus,"
he said, in a slow, feeble voice, raising his bloated hand
and pointing at his forehead with the first three of its
dimpled fingers. "Now repeat after me: 'I promise and
swear by the Almighty God, His Holy Gospel, and by
the life-giving cross of our Lord, that in the case'"&mdash;he
continued, resting after each phrase. "Don't drop your
hand; hold it thus," he turned to a young man who let
his hand fall&mdash;"'that in the case which&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>The portly, whiskered gentleman, the colonel, merchant
and others held their hands as directed by the
priest, and seemed to do so with particular pleasure,
holding their hands quite high, and their fingers most
proper; others seemed to do it against their will, and
carelessly. Some repeated the words too loudly, in a
provoking manner, with an expression on the face which
seemed to say: "I will repeat as I please;" others whispered,
fell behind the priest and then, as if frightened,
hastened to catch up with him. Some held their fingers
tightly closed, as if challenging anyone to part them;
others, again, loosened them, now closed them again.
After the jury was sworn, the presiding justice directed
them to choose a foreman. They arose and, crowding
each other, went into the consultation room, where almost
every one produced cigarettes and began to smoke.
Some one proposed the portly gentleman, who was immediately
chosen, then they threw away their cigarettes
and returned to the court. The gentleman declared to
the presiding justice that he was chosen foreman, and
stepping over the feet of each other, the jury again seated
themselves in the two rows of high-backed chairs.</p>

<p>Everything proceeded smoothly, quickly and not without
solemnity, and the regularity, order and solemnity
evidently pleased the participants, confirming their sense
of rendering important public service. Nekhludoff also
experienced this feeling.</p>

<p>As soon as the jury seated themselves the presiding
justice instructed them in their rights, duties and responsibilities.
While speaking, he was constantly changing
his attitude; now he leaned on his right hand, now on his
left; then he reclined in his chair, or rested his hands on
the arms of the chair, smoothed the corners of the
paper on the table, polished the paper-knife or clutched
the lead pencil.</p>

<p>Their rights, according to him, consisted in that they
were allowed to question prisoners, through the presiding
justice; they might keep pencils and paper, and
might also view exhibits. Their duties consisted in not
giving a false verdict. And their responsibilities consisted
in that if they failed to keep secret their deliberations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>or spoke to outsiders, they would be liable to punishment.</p>

<p>They all listened with respectful attention. The merchant,
from whom the fumes of wine spread through the
jury box, and who was suppressing the noisy rising of
gases in his stomach, approvingly nodded at every sentence.</p>

<p>After he had finished the instructions, the presiding
justice turned to the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Simon Kartinkin, rise!" he said.</p>

<p>Simon sprang up nervously. The muscles of his cheeks
began to twitch still quicker.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Simon Petroff Kartinkin," he said quickly, in a sharp
voice, evidently prepared for the question.</p>

<p>"What estate?"</p>

<p>"Peasant."</p>

<p>"What government, district?"</p>

<p>"Government of Tula, district of Krapivensk, Kupian
township, village of Borki."</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-four; born in eighteen hundred&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What faith?"</p>

<p>"Of the Russian orthodox faith."</p>

<p>"Are you married?"</p>

<p>"O, no!"</p>

<p>"What is your occupation?"</p>

<p>"I was employed in the Hotel Mauritania."</p>

<p>"Were you ever arrested before?"</p>

<p>"I was never arrested before, because where I
lived&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were not arrested?"</p>

<p>"God forbid! Never!"</p>

<p>"Have you received a copy of the indictment?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sit down. Euphemia Ivanovna Bochkova!" The presiding
justice turned to the next prisoner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>But Simon remained standing in front of Bochkova.</p>

<p>"Kartinkin, sit down!"</p>

<p>Kartinkin still remained standing.</p>

<p>"Kartinkin, sit down!"</p>

<p>But Kartinkin stood still until the usher, his head leaning
to the side, and with wide-open eyes, whispered to him
in a tragic tone:</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down!"</p>

<p>Kartinkin sat down as quickly as he rose, and wrapping
himself in his coat began to move his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Your name?" With a sigh of weariness the presiding
justice turned to the next prisoner without looking at her,
and consulted a paper before him. He was so accustomed
to the business that to expedite matters he could try two
cases at once.</p>

<p>Bochkova was forty-two years old, a burgess of the
town of Koloma; by occupation a servant&mdash;in the same
Hotel Mauritania. Was never arrested before, and had
received a copy of the indictment. She gave the answers
very boldly and with an intonation which seemed to add
to every answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bochkova, Euphemia, have received a copy, and
am proud of it, and will permit no one to laugh at me."</p>

<p>Without waiting to be told to sit down, Bochkova sat
down immediately after the questioning ceased.</p>

<p>"Your name?" asked the presiding justice of the third
prisoner. "You must rise," he added, gently and courteously,
seeing Maslova still in her seat.</p>

<p>With quick movement Maslova rose with an air of
submissiveness, and throwing back her shoulders, looked
into the face of the presiding justice with her smiling,
somewhat squinting black eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you called?"</p>

<p>"They used to call me Lubka," she answered, rapidly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nekhludoff put on his pince-nez and examined
the prisoners while they were questioned.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," he thought, looking intently at the
prisoner. "But her name is Lubka," he thought, as he
heard her answer.</p>

<p>The presiding justice was about to continue his interrogation
when the member with the eye-glasses, angrily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>whispering something, stopped him. The presiding justice
nodded his assent and turned to the prisoner.</p>

<p>"You say 'Lubka,' but a different name is entered here."</p>

<p>The prisoner was silent.</p>

<p>"I ask you what is your real name?"</p>

<p>"What name did you receive at baptism?" asked the
angry member.</p>

<p>"Formerly I was called Katherine."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," Nekhludoff continued to repeat, although
there was no doubt in his mind now that it was she,
that same servant ward with whom he had been in love
at one time&mdash;yes, in love, real love, and whom in a moment
of mental fever he led astray, then abandoned,
and to whom he never gave a second thought, because the
recollection of it was too painful, revealed too manifestly
that he, who prided himself of his good breeding, not only
did not treat her decently, but basely deceived her.</p>

<p>Yes, it was she. He saw plainly the mysterious peculiarity
that distinguishes every individual from every other
individual. Notwithstanding the unnatural whiteness and
fullness of her face, this pleasant peculiarity was in the
face, in the lips, in the slightly squinting eyes, and, principally,
in the naive, smiling glance, and in the expression
of submissiveness not only in the face, but in the whole
figure.</p>

<p>"You should have said so," again very gently said the
presiding justice. "What is your patronymic?"</p>

<p>"I am illegitimate," said Maslova.</p>

<p>"But yet you were named after your godfather?"</p>

<p>"Michailova."</p>

<p>"What crime could she have committed?" Nekhludoff
thought meanwhile, his breath almost failing him.</p>

<p>"What is your surname&mdash;your family name?" continued
the presiding justice.</p>

<p>"Maslova&mdash;after my mother."</p>

<p>"Your estate?"</p>

<p>"Burgess."</p>

<p>"Of the orthodox faith?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Your occupation? What was your occupation?"</p>

<p>Maslova was silent.</p>

<p>"What was your occupation?" repeated the justiciary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>"You know!" said Maslova. She smiled and quickly
glanced around, then looked squarely at the justiciary.</p>

<p>There was something so unusual in the expression of
her face&mdash;something so terrible and piteous in the meaning
of her words, in that smile, that quick glance which
she cast over the court-room&mdash;that the justiciary hung
his head, and for a moment there was perfect silence.</p>

<p>A burst of laughter from some spectator interrupted the
silence. Some one hissed. The justiciary raised his head
and continued the interrogation.</p>

<p>"Were you ever arrested?"</p>

<p>"No." Maslova said in an undertone, sighing.</p>

<p>"Have you received a copy of the indictment?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sit down."</p>

<p>The prisoner raised her skirt with the customary movement
of a fashionable lady, arranging her train, and sat
down, folding her hands in the sleeves of her coat, and
still looking at the justiciary.</p>

<p>Then began the recounting of witnesses, their removal
to a separate room, the decision on the evidence of the
medical expert. Then the secretary arose and began to
read the indictment, loud and with distinctness, but so rapidly
that his incorrect sounding of the letters l and r
turned his reading into one continuous, weary drone. The
judges leaned now on one side, now on the other side of
their arm-chairs, then on the table, and again on the backs
of the chairs, or closed their eyes, or opened them and
whispered to each other. One of the gendarmes several
times stifled a yawn.</p>

<p>The convulsions of Kartinkin's cheeks did not cease.
Bochkova sat quietly and erect, now and then scratching
with her finger under her cap.</p>

<p>Maslova sat motionless, listening to the reading, and
looking at the clerk; at times she shuddered and made a
movement as if desiring to object, blushed, then sighed
deeply, changed the position of her hands, glanced around
and again looked at the clerk.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff sat on the high-backed chair in the front
row, second to the aisle, and without removing his pince-nez
looked at Maslova, while his soul was being racked by
a fierce and complicated struggle.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>The indictment read as follows:</p>

<p>"On the 17th of January, 18&mdash;, suddenly died in the
Hotel Mauritania, merchant of the second guild, Therapont
Emelianovich Smelkoff.</p>

<p>"The local police physician certified that the cause of
death of said Smelkoff was rupture of the heart, caused
by excessive use of liquor.</p>

<p>"The body of Smelkoff was interred.</p>

<p>"On the 21st day of January, a townsman and comrade
of Smelkoff, on returning from St. Petersburg, and hearing
of the circumstances of his death, declared his suspicion
that Smelkoff was poisoned with a view of robbing
him of the money he carried about his person.</p>

<p>"This suspicion was confirmed at the preliminary inquest,
by which it was established: 1. That Smelkoff had
drawn from the bank, some time before his death, three
thousand eight hundred rubles; that, after a due and careful
inventory of the money of the deceased, only three
hundred and twelve rubles and sixteen kopecks were
found. 2. That the entire day and evening preceding his
death deceased passed in the company of a girl named
Lubka (Katherine Maslova) in the Hotel Mauritania,
whither said Maslova came at the request of Smelkoff
for money; that she obtained the money from Smelkoff's
trunk, first unlocking it with a key intrusted to her by
Smelkoff; that the money was thus taken in the presence
of two servants of the said hotel&mdash;Euphemia Bochkova
and Simon Kartinkin; that at the opening of said
trunk by the said Maslova in the presence of the aforementioned
Bochkova and Kartinkin, there were rolls of
hundred ruble bills. 3. That on the return of said
Smelkoff and Maslova to the said hotel, the said Maslova,
on the advice of the said servant Kartinkin, administered
to the deceased a glass of brandy, in which she put
a white powder given her by said Kartinkin. 4. That
on the following morning Lubka (Katherine Maslova)
sold to her mistress, Rosanova, a diamond ring belonging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>to Smelkoff, said ring she alleged to have been presented
to her by said Smelkoff. 5. That the servant of said Hotel
Mauritania, Euphemia Bochkova, deposited in her name
in the local Bank of Commerce the sum of eighteen hundred
rubles.</p>

<p>"At the autopsy held on the body of Smelkoff, and after
the removal of the intestines, the presence of poison was
readily discovered, leaving no doubt that death was caused
by poisoning.</p>

<p>"The prisoners, Maslova, Bochkova and Kartinkin
pleaded not guilty. Maslova declared that she did go to
the Hotel Mauritania, as stated, for the purpose of fetching
some money for the merchant, and that opening the
trunk with the key given to her by the merchant, she took
only forty rubles, as she was directed, but took no more,
which fact can be substantiated by Bochkova and Kartinkin,
in whose presence she took the money and locked the
trunk. She further testified that during her second visit
to the room of the merchant she gave him, at the instigation
of Kartinkin, several powders in a glass of brandy,
which she considered to be narcotic, in order that she
might get away from him. The ring was presented to her
by Smelkoff when she cried and was about to leave him
after he had beaten her.</p>

<p>"Euphemia Bochkova testified that she knew nothing
about the missing money, never entered the merchant's
room, which Lubka herself kept in order, and that if anything
was stolen from the merchant, it was done by Lubka
when she came to the room for the money."</p>

<p>At this point Maslova shuddered, and with open mouth
looked at Bochkova.</p>

<p>"And when Euphemia Bochkova was shown her bank
account of eighteen hundred rubles," continued the secretary,
"and asked how she came by the money, she testified
that the money was saved from their earnings by herself
and Simon Kartinkin, whom she intended to marry.</p>

<p>"Simon Kartinkin, on his part, at the first examination,
confessed that, at the instigation of Maslova, who brought
the key to the trunk, he and Bochkova stole the money,
which was afterwards divided between the three."</p>

<p>At this Maslova shuddered again, sprang to her feet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>turned red in the face, and began to say something, but
the usher bade her be quiet.</p>

<p>"Finally," continued the secretary, "Kartinkin also confessed
to giving Maslova the powders to put the merchant
to sleep. On the second examination, however, he denied
having either stolen the money, or given Maslova the powders,
but charged Maslova with both. As to the money
placed by Bochkova in the bank, he declared, in accordance
with Bochkova's testimony, that they had saved it
during their twelve years' service in the hotel."</p>

<p>The indictment wound up as follows:</p>

<p>"In view of the aforesaid the defendants, Simon Kartinkin,
peasant of the village of Borkoff, thirty-three years
of age; burgess Euphemia Ivanova Bochkova, forty-two
years of age, and burgess Katherine Maslova, twenty-seven
years of age, conspired on the 17th day of January,
188&mdash;, to administer poison to merchant Smelkoff with
intent to kill and rob him, and did on said day administer
to said Smelkoff poison, from which poison the said Smelkoff
died, and did thereafter rob him of a diamond ring
and twenty-five hundred rubles, contrary to the laws in
such cases made and provided. <a name="Chapter_1453" id="Chapter_1453"></a>Chapter 1453, sections 4
and 5, Penal Code.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, in accordance with chapter 201 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, the said peasant, Simon
Kartinkin, burgess Euphemia Bochkova and burgess
Katherine Maslova are subject to trial by jury, the case
being within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court."</p>

<p>The clerk having finished the reading of the long indictment,
folded the papers, seated himself at his desk
and began to arrange his long hair. Every one present
gave a sigh of relief, and with the consciousness that the
trial had already begun, everything would be cleared up
and justice would finally be done, leaned back on their
chairs.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff alone did not experience this feeling. He
was absorbed in the horrible thought that the same Maslova,
whom he knew as an innocent and beautiful girl
ten years ago, could be guilty of such a crime.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>When the reading of the indictment was finished, the
justiciary, having consulted with his associates, turned to
Kartinkin with an expression on his face which plainly
betokened confidence in his ability to bring forth all the
truth.</p>

<p>"Simon Kartinkin," he called, leaning to the left.</p>

<p>Simon Kartinkin rose, put out his chest, incessantly
moving his cheeks.</p>

<p>"You are charged, together with Euphemia Bochkova
and Katherine Maslova, with stealing from the trunk of
the merchant <a name="Smelkoff" id="Smelkoff"></a>Smelkoff money belonging to him, and subsequently
brought arsenic and induced Maslova to administer
it to Smelkoff, by reason of which he came to his
death. Are you guilty or not guilty?" he said, leaning to
the right.</p>

<p>"It is impossible, because our business is to attend the
guests&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will speak afterwards. Are you guilty or not?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can speak later. Do you admit that you are
guilty?" calmly but firmly repeated the justiciary.</p>

<p>"I cannot do it because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the usher sprang toward Simon and with a tragic
whisper stopped him.</p>

<p>The justiciary, with an expression showing that the
questioning was at an end, moved the hand in which
he held a document to another place, and turned to Euphemia
Bochkova.</p>

<p>"Euphemia Bochkova, you, with Kartinkin and Maslova,
are charged with stealing, on the 17th day of January,
188&mdash;, at the Hotel Mauritania, from the trunk of
the merchant Smelkoff, money and a ring, and dividing
the same among yourselves, and with a view of hiding
your crime, administered poison to him, from the effects
of which he died. Are you guilty?"</p>

<p>"I am not guilty of anything," boldly and firmly answered
the prisoner. "I never entered the room&mdash;and as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>that scurvy woman did go into the room, she, then, did
the business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will speak afterwards," again said the justiciary,
with the same gentleness and firmness. "So you are not
guilty?"</p>

<p>"I did not take the money, did not give him the poison,
did not go into the room. If I were in the room I should
have thrown her out."</p>

<p>"You are not guilty, then?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"Katherine Maslova," began the justiciary, turning to
the third prisoner. "The charge against you is that, having
come to the Hotel Mauritania with the key to Smelkoff's
trunk, you stole therefrom money and a ring," he
said, like one repeating a lesson learned by rote, and
leaning his ear to the associate sitting on his left, who
said that he noticed that the phial mentioned in the list
of exhibits was missing. "Stole therefrom money and a
ring," repeated the justiciary, "and after dividing the
money again returned with the merchant Smelkoff to the
Hotel Mauritania, and there administered to him poison,
from the effects of which he died. Are you guilty or not
guilty?"</p>

<p>"I am not guilty of anything," she answered, quickly.
"As I said before, so I repeat now: I never, never, never
took the money; I did not take anything, and the ring he
gave me himself."</p>

<p>"You do not plead guilty of stealing twenty-five hundred
rubles?" said the justiciary.</p>

<p>"I say I didn't take anything but forty rubles."</p>

<p>"And do you plead guilty to the charge of giving the
merchant Smelkoff powders in his wine?"</p>

<p>"To that I plead guilty. Only I thought, as I was told,
that they would put him to sleep, and that no harm could
come from them. I did not wish, nor thought of doing
him any harm. Before God, I say that I did not," she
said.</p>

<p>"So you deny that you are guilty of stealing the money
and ring from the merchant Smelkoff," said the justiciary,
"but you admit that you gave him the powders?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I admit, only I thought that they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>sleeping powders. I only gave them to him that he might
fall asleep&mdash;never wished, nor thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well," said the justiciary, evidently satisfied with
the results of the examinations. "Now tell us how it
happened," he said, leaning his elbows on the arms of
the chair and putting his hands on the table. "Tell us
everything. By confessing frankly you will improve your
present condition."</p>

<p>Maslova, still looking straight at the justiciary, was
silent.</p>

<p>"Tell us what took place."</p>

<p>"What took place?" suddenly said <a name="Maslova" id="Maslova"></a>Maslova. "I came
to the hotel; I was taken to the room; he was there, and
was already very drunk." (She pronounced the word "he"
with a peculiar expression of horror and with wide-open
eyes.) "I wished to depart; he would not let me."</p>

<p>She became silent, as if she had lost the thread of the
story, or thought of something else.</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"What then? Then I remained there awhile and went
home."</p>

<p>At this point the assistant public prosecutor half rose
from his seat, uncomfortably resting on one elbow.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to question the prisoner?" asked the justiciary,
and receiving an affirmative answer, motioned his
assent.</p>

<p>"I would like to put this question: Has the prisoner
been acquainted with Simon Kartinkin before?" asked
the assistant prosecutor without looking at Maslova.</p>

<p>And having asked the question he pressed his lips and
frowned.</p>

<p>The justiciary repeated the question. Maslova looked
with frightened eyes at the prosecutor.</p>

<p>"With Simon? I was," she said.</p>

<p>"I would like to know now, what was the character of
the acquaintance that existed between them. Have they
met often?"</p>

<p>"What acquaintance? He invited me to meet guests;
there was no acquaintance," answered Maslova, throwing
restless glances now at the prosecutor, now at the justiciary.</p>

<p>"I would like to know why did Kartinkin invite Maslova
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>only, and not other girls?" asked the prosecutor, with
a Mephistophelian smile, winking his eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know. How can I tell?" answered Maslova,
glancing around her, frightened, and for a moment resting
her eyes on Nekhludoff. "He invited whomever he
wished."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that she recognized me?" Nekhludoff
thought, with horror. He felt his blood rising to his head,
but Maslova did not recognize him. She turned away
immediately, and with frightened eyes gazed at the prosecutor.</p>

<p>"Then the prisoner denies that she had intimate relations
with Kartinkin? Very well. I have no more questions
to ask."</p>

<p>He removed his elbow from the desk, and began to
make notes. In reality, instead of making notes, he merely
drew lines across his notes, having seen prosecutors
and attorneys, after an adroit question, making memoranda
of questions which were to crush their opponents.</p>

<p>The justiciary did not turn immediately to the prisoner,
because he was at the moment asking his associate
in the eye-glasses whether he consented to the questions
previously outlined and committed to writing.</p>

<p>"What followed?" the justiciary continued.</p>

<p>"I came home," Maslova continued, looking somewhat
bolder, "and went to sleep. As soon as I was asleep our
girl, Bertha, came and woke me. 'Your merchant is here
again. Wake up.' Then he"&mdash;again she pronounced it
with evident horror&mdash;"he wished to send for wine, but
was short of money. Then he sent me to the hotel, telling
me where the money was and how much to take, and
I went."</p>

<p>The justiciary was whispering at the time to his associate
on the left, and did not listen to Maslova, but to
make it appear that he had heard everything he repeated
her last words.</p>

<p>"And you went. Well, what else?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I came there and did as he told me. I went to his
room. I did not enter it alone, but called Simon Michaelovich
and her," she said, pointing to Bochkova.</p>

<p>"She lies; I never entered&mdash;&mdash;" Bochkova began, but
she was stopped.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>"In their presence I took four ten ruble bills," she continued.</p>

<p>"And while taking this money, did the prisoner see
how much money there was?" asked the prosecutor.</p>

<p>Maslova shuddered as soon as the prosecutor began to
speak. She could not tell why, but she felt that he was
her enemy.</p>

<p>"I did not count it, but I saw that it was all hundred
ruble bills."</p>

<p>"The prisoner saw hundred ruble bills. I have no other
questions."</p>

<p>"Well, did you bring back the money?" asked the justiciary,
looking at the clock.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"Then he again took me with him," said Maslova.</p>

<p>"And how did you give him the powder in the wine?"
asked the justiciary.</p>

<p>"How? Poured it into the wine and gave it to him."</p>

<p>"Why did you give it to him?"</p>

<p>Without answering, she sighed deeply. After a short
silence she said:</p>

<p>"He would not let me go. He exhausted me. I went
into the corridor and said to Simon Michaelovich: 'If
he would only let me go; I am so tired.' And Simon
Michaelovich said: 'We are also tired of him. We intend
to give him sleeping powders. When he is asleep
you can go.' 'All right,' I said. I thought that it was a
harmless powder. He gave me a package. I entered.
He lay behind the partition, and ordered me to bring
him some brandy. I took from the table a bottle of feen-champagne,
poured into two glasses&mdash;for myself and him&mdash;threw
the powder into his glass and handed it to him.
I would not have given it to him if I had known it."</p>

<p>"And how did you come by the ring?" asked the justiciary.</p>

<p>"He presented it to me."</p>

<p>"When did he present it to you?"</p>

<p>"When we reached his room. I wished to depart. Then
he struck me on the head and broke my comb. I was
angered, and wished to go. Then he took the ring from
his finger and gave it to me, asking me to stay," she said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Here the assistant prosecutor again rose, and with a
dissimulating naiveness asked permission to ask a few
more questions, which was granted, and leaning his head
on his gold-embroidered collar, he asked:</p>

<p>"I would like to know how long was the prisoner in
the room with Smelkoff?"</p>

<p>Maslova was again terror-stricken, and with her frightened
eyes wandering from the prosecutor to the justiciary,
she answered, hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I do not remember how long."</p>

<p>"And does the prisoner remember entering another
part of the hotel after she had left Smelkoff?"</p>

<p>Maslova was thinking.</p>

<p>"Into the next room&mdash;an empty one," she said.</p>

<p>"Why did you enter that room?" said the assistant
prosecutor, impulsively.</p>

<p>"To wait for a cabriolet."</p>

<p>"Was not Kartinkin in the room with the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"He also came in."</p>

<p>"Why did he come in?"</p>

<p>"There was the merchant's feen-champagne left, and
we drank it together."</p>

<p>"Oh, drank together. Very well."</p>

<p>"And did the prisoner have any conversation with Simon,
and what was the subject of the conversation?"</p>

<p>Maslova suddenly frowned, her face turned red, and
she quickly answered:</p>

<p>"What I said? I know nothing more. Do what you
please with me. I am innocent, and that is all. I did not
say anything. I told everything that happened."</p>

<p>"I have no more questions to ask," said the prosecutor
to the court, and uplifting his shoulders he began to add
to the memorandums of his speech that the prisoner herself
confessed to entering an empty room with Simon.</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"Have you anything else to say?"</p>

<p>"I have told everything," she said, sighing, and took her
seat.</p>

<p>The justiciary then made some notes, and after he had
listened to a suggestion whispered by the associate on the
left, declared a recess of ten minutes, and, hastily rising,
walked out of the court-room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>After the judges had risen, the jury, lawyers and witness
also rose, and with the pleasant feeling of having
already performed part of an important work, began to
move hither and thither.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff walked into the jury-room and took a seat
near the window.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>Yes, it was Katiousha.</p>

<p>The relations of Nekhludoff to Katiousha were the following:</p>

<p>Nekhludoff first met Katiousha when he went to stay
one summer out at the estate of his aunts in order that
he might quietly prepare his thesis on the private ownership
of land. Ordinarily he lived on the estate of his
mother, near Moskow, with his mother and sister. But
that year his sister married, and his mother went abroad.
Nekhludoff had to write a composition in the course of
his university studies, and decided to pass the summer
at his aunts'. There in the woods it was quiet, and there
was nothing to distract him from his studies. Besides,
the aunts loved their nephew and heir, and he loved them,
loved their old-fashioned way of living.</p>

<p>During that summer Nekhludoff experienced that exaltation
which youth comes to know not by the teaching
of others, but when it naturally begins to recognize the
beauty and importance of life, and man's serious place
in it; when it sees the possibility of infinite perfection
of which the world is capable, and devotes itself to that
endeavor, not only with the hope, but with a full conviction
of reaching that perfection which it imagines possible.
While in the university he had that year read
Spencer's Social Statics, and Spencer's reasoning bearing
on private ownership of land produced a strong impression
on him, especially because he was himself the son
of a landed proprietress. His father was not rich, but
his mother received as her marriage portion ten thousand
acres of land. He then for the first time understood all
the injustice of private ownership of land, and being one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>of those to whom any sacrifice in the name of moral duty
was a lofty spiritual enjoyment, he forthwith divided the
land he had inherited from his father among the peasants.
On this subject he was then composing a disquisition.</p>

<p>His life on the estate of his aunts was ordered in the
following way: He rose very early, some times at three
o'clock, and till sunrise bathed in the river under a hill,
often in the morning mist, and returned when the dew
was yet on the grass and flowers. Some mornings he
would, after partaking of coffee, sit down to write his
composition, or read references bearing on the subject.
But, above all, he loved to ramble in the woods. Before
dinner he would lie down in the woods and sleep; then,
at dinner, he made merry, jesting with his aunts; then
went out riding or rowing. In the evening he read again,
or joined his aunts, solving riddles for them. On moonlit
nights he seldom slept, because of the immense joy
of life that pervaded him, and instead of sleeping, he
sometimes rambled in the garden till daylight, absorbed
in his thoughts and phantasies.</p>

<p>Thus he lived happily the first month under the roof
of his aunts' dwelling, paying no attention to the half-servant,
half-ward, the black-eyed, nimble-footed Katiousha.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff, raised under the protecting wing of his
mother, was at nineteen a perfectly innocent youth. He
dreamed of woman, but only as wife. All those women
who, according to his view, could not be considered as
likely to become his wife, were to him not women, but
people. But it happened on Ascension Day that there was
visiting his aunts a lady from the neighborhood with her
two young daughters, her son and a local artist who was
staying with them.</p>

<p>After tea had been served the entire company, as usual,
repaired to the meadow, where they played blind man's
buff. Katiousha went with them. After some exchanges
came Nekhludoff's turn to run with Katiousha. Nekhludoff
always liked to see Katiousha, but it had never occurred
to him that their relations could ever be any but
the most formal.</p>

<p>"It will be difficult to catch them now," said the cheerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>artist, whose short and curved legs carried him very
swiftly, "unless they stumble."</p>

<p>"You could not catch them."</p>

<p>"One, two, three!"</p>

<p>They clapped their hands three times. Almost bursting
into laughter, Katiousha quickly changed places with
Nekhludoff, and pressing with her strong, rough little
hand his large hand she ran to the left, rustling her
starched skirt.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff was a swift runner; he wished to out-distance
the artist, and ran with all his might. As he turned
around he saw the artist catching up with Katiousha, but
with her supple limbs she gained on him and ran to the
left. In front of them was a patch of lilac bushes, behind
which no one ran, but Katiousha, turning toward Nekhludoff,
motioned him with her head to join her there. He
understood her, and ran behind the bushes. But here was
a ditch overgrown with nettles, whose presence was unknown
to Nekhludoff. He stumbled and fell, stinging and
wetting his hands in the evening dew that was now falling,
but, laughing, he straightened himself and ran into
the open.</p>

<p>Katiousha, her black eyes beaming with joy, ran toward
him. They met and caught each others' hands.</p>

<p>"You were stung by the nettles, I suppose," she said, arranging
with her free hand her loosened braid, breathing
heavily, and looking up into his eyes.</p>

<p>"I did not know there was a ditch," he said, also smiling,
and still keeping her hand in his.</p>

<p>She advanced a little, and he, without being able to account
for it, inclined his face toward hers. She did not
draw back. He pressed her hand and kissed her on the
lips.</p>

<p>She uttered an exclamation, and with a swift movement,
releasing her hand, she ran in the direction of the crowd.</p>

<p>Plucking two lilac twigs from the lilac bush, fanning
her flushed face with them, and glancing around toward
him, she ran to the players, briskly waving her hands.</p>

<p>From this day on the relations between Nekhludoff
and Katiousha were changed, and there were established
between them those peculiar relations which are customary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>between two innocent young people who are attached
to each other.</p>

<p>As soon as Katiousha entered the room, or even when
Nekhludoff saw her white apron from afar, everything
became immediately as if lit by the sun; everything became
more interesting, more cheerful, more important;
life became more joyful. She experienced the same feeling.
But not alone the presence and proximity of Katiousha
had such effect upon Nekhludoff; the very thought of
her existence had the same power upon him as that of his
had upon her. Whether he received an unpleasant letter
from his mother, or was backward in his composition, or
felt the ceaseless sadness of youth, it would suffice for him
to see her and his spirit resumed its wonted good cheer.</p>

<p>Katiousha had to do all the housework, but she managed
to do her duty and found spare time for reading. He
gave her the works of Dostoievsky and Tourgenieff to
read. Those descriptive of the beauties of nature she
liked best. Their conversations were but momentary,
when they met in the corridor, on the veranda, in the
court-yard, or in the room of the aunts' old servant, Matriena
Pavlovna, with whom Katiousha roomed, or in the
servants' chamber, whither Nekhludoff sometimes went
to drink tea. And these conversations in the presence of
Matriena Pavlovna were the pleasantest. When they
were alone their conversation flagged. Then the eyes
would speak something different, more important, than
the mouth; the lips were drawn up, they felt uncomfortable,
and quickly parted.</p>

<p>These relations continued during the time of his first
visit to his aunts. The aunts noticed them, were dismayed,
and immediately wrote to the Princess Elena Ivanovna,
Nekhludoff's mother. But their anxiety was unfounded;
Nekhludoff, without knowing it, loved Katiousha, as innocent
people love, and this very love was the principal
safeguard against either his or her fall. Not only did he
not desire to possess her physically, but the very thought
of such relation horrified him. There was more reason in
the poetical Sophia Ivanovna's fear that Nekhludoff's
having fallen in love with a girl, might take a notion to
marry her without regard to her birth or station.</p>

<p>If Nekhludoff were clearly conscious of his love for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Katiousha; especially if it were sought to persuade him that
he could and must not link his fate to that of the girl, he
would very likely have decided in his plumb-line mind that
there was no reason why he should not marry her, no matter
who she was, provided he loved her. But the aunts
did not speak of their fears, and he departed without
knowing that he was enamored of Katiousha.</p>

<p>He was certain that his feeling toward Katiousha was
but a manifestation of that joy which pervaded his entire
being, and which was shared by that lovely, cheerful girl.
However, when he was taking leave, and Katiousha, standing
on the veranda with the aunts, followed him with her
black, tearful and somewhat squinting eyes, he felt that
he was leaving behind him something beautiful, precious,
which would never recur. And he became very sad.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Katiousha. I thank you for everything," he
said, over the cap of Sophia Ivanovna, and seated himself
in the cabriolet.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Dmitri Ivanovich," she said, in her pleasant,
caressing voice, and holding back the tears which
filled her eyes, ran into her room, where she could cry
freely.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>For three years afterward Nekhludoff did not see
Katiousha. But when, as staff-officer, he was on his way
to his army post, he paid a short visit to his aunts, but an
entirely different man. Three years ago he was an honest,
self-denying youth, ready to devote himself to every good
cause; now he was a corrupt and refined egotist, given
over to personal enjoyment. Then, the world appeared to
him as a mystery which he joyfully and enthusiastically
tried to solve; now, everything in this world was plain
and simple, and was determined by those conditions of
life in which he found himself. Then, it was necessary
and important to hold communion with nature and with
those people who lived, thought and felt before him
(philosophers, poets); now, human institutions were the
only things necessary and important, and communion he
held with his comrades. Woman, then, appeared to him a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>mysterious and charming creature; now, he looked on
woman, on every woman, except nearest relations and
wives of friends, as a means of gratifying now tried pleasures.
Then, he needed no money, and wanted not a third
part what his mother gave him, disclaimed title to his
father's land, distributing it among the peasants; now, the
fifteen hundred rubles' monthly allowance he received
from his mother did not suffice for his needs, and he often
made it the cause of unpleasant conversation with her.
His true self he then considered his spiritual being; now,
his healthy, vigorous, animal self was his true ego.</p>

<p>And all this terrible transformation took place in him
only because he ceased to have faith in himself, and began
to believe in others. To live according to the faith that
was in him was burdensome; every question would have
to be decided almost always against his animal ego, which
was seeking light pleasures; but reposing his faith in
others, there remained nothing to decide, everything having
been decided, and decided always against the spiritual
and in favor of the animal ego. Besides, following his
inner faith, he was always subject to the censure of people;
in the other case he received the approval of the people
that surrounded him.</p>

<p>Thus, when Nekhludoff was thinking, reading, speaking
of God, of truth, of wealth, of poverty, everybody
considered it out of place and somewhat queer, while his
mother and aunt, with good-natured irony, called him
notre cher philosophe. When, however, he was reading
novels, relating indecent anecdotes or seeing droll
vaudevilles in the French theatre, and afterward
merrily repeated them, everybody praised and encouraged
him. When he considered it necessary to curtail his
needs, wore an old coat and gave up wine-drinking, everybody
considered it eccentric and vain originality; but
when he spent large sums in organizing a chase, or building
an unusual, luxurious cabinet, everybody praised his
taste and sent him valuable gifts. When he was chaste,
and wished to preserve his chastity till marriage, his relatives
were anxious about his health, and his mother, so
far from being mortified, rather rejoiced when she learned
that he had become a real man, and had enticed the French
mistress of some friend of his. As to the Katiousha <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>episode&mdash;that
the thought might occur to him of marrying
her, she could not even think of without horror.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Nekhludoff, on reaching his majority,
distributed the estate he inherited from his father among
the peasants, because he considered the ownership of land
unjust, this act of his horrified his mother and relatives,
who constantly reproached and ridiculed him for it. He
was told unceasingly that so far from enriching it only
impoverished the peasants, who opened three liquor stores
and stopped working entirely. When, however, Nekhludoff
joined the Guards, and spent and gambled away so
much money that Elena Ivanovna had to draw from her
capital, she scarcely grieved, considering it quite natural
and even beneficial to be thus inoculated when young and
in good society.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff at first struggled, but the struggle was very
hard, for whatever he did, following the faith that was in
him, was considered wrong by others, and, contrariwise,
whatever he considered wrong was approved of by his
relatives. The result was that Nekhludoff ceased to have
faith in himself and began to follow others. At first this
renunciation of self was unpleasant, but it was short lived,
and Nekhludoff, who now began to smoke and drink wine,
soon ceased to experience this unpleasant feeling, and was
even greatly relieved.</p>

<p>Passionate by nature, Nekhludoff gave himself up entirely
to this new life, approved of by all those that surrounded
him, and completely stifled in himself that voice
which demanded something different. It commenced
with his removal to St. Petersburg, and ended with his
entry upon active service.</p>

<p>During this period of his life Nekhludoff felt the ecstasy
of freedom from all those moral impediments which
he had formerly placed before himself, and continued in
a chronic condition of insane egotism.</p>

<p>He was in this condition when, three years afterward,
he visited his aunts.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff called at his aunts because their manor lay
on the road through which his regiment had preceded him,
and also because they requested him to do so, but principally
in order that he might see Katiousha. It may be
that in the depth of his soul there was already a mischievous
intention toward Katiousha, prompted by his now unbridled
animal ego, but he was not aware of it, he merely
desired to visit those places in which he lived so happily,
and see his somewhat queer, but amiable and good-natured,
aunts, who always surrounded the atmosphere around him
with love and admiration, and also to see the lovely
Katiousha, of whom he had such pleasant recollections.</p>

<p>He arrived toward the end of March, on Good Friday,
in the season of bad roads, when the rain was falling in
torrents, and was wet all through, and chilled to the marrow
of his bones, but courageous and excited, as he always
felt at that time of the year.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she is still there?" he thought, as he drove
into the familiar court-yard of the old manor, which was
covered with snow that fell from the roofs, and was surrounded
by a low brick wall. He expected that the ringing
of the bell would bring her running to meet him, but
on the perron of the servants' quarters appeared two bare-footed
women with tucked-up skirts, carrying buckets,
who were apparently scrubbing floors. She was not on the
front perron, either; only Timon, the lackey, came forth in
an apron, also apparently occupied with cleaning. Sophia
Ivanovna came into the ante-chamber, attired in a silk
dress and cap.</p>

<p>"How glad I am that you came!" said Sophia Ivanovna.
"Masheuka<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> is somewhat ill. We were to church, receiving
the sacrament. She is very tired."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Aunt Sonia,"<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> said Nekhludoff,
kissing the hand of Sophia Ivanovna. "Pardon me, I
have soiled you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>"Go to your room. You are wet all through. Oh, what
a mustache! Katiousha! Katiousha! Bring him some
coffee quickly."</p>

<p>"All right!" responded a familiar, pleasant voice. Nekhludoff's
heart fluttered. "She is here!" To him it was
like the sun rising from behind the clouds, and he cheerfully
went with Timon to his old room to change his clothing.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff wished to ask Timon about Katiousha. Was
she well? How did she fare? Was she not engaged to
be married? But Timon was so respectful, and at the
same time so rigid; he so strictly insisted on himself pouring
the water from the pitcher over Nekhludoff's hands,
that the latter could not decide to ask him about Katiousha,
and only inquired about his grand-children, about the old
stallion, about the watch-dog Polkan. They were all well,
except Polkan, who had gone mad the previous year.</p>

<p>After he had thrown off his wet clothes, and as he was
about to dress himself, Nekhludoff heard quick steps and
a rapping at the door. He recognized both the steps and
the rapping. Only <i>she</i> walked and rapped thus.</p>

<p>It was Katiousha&mdash;the same Katiousha&mdash;only more lovely
than before. The naive, smiling, somewhat squinting
black eyes still looked up; she wore a clean white apron,
as before. She brought a perfumed piece of soap, just
taken from the wrapper, and two towels&mdash;one Russian
and the other Turkish. The freshly unpacked soap, the
towels and she herself, were all equally clean, fresh, pure
and pleasant. The lovely, firm, red lips became creased
from unrestrainable happiness at sight of him.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Dmitri Ivanovich?" she said, with
difficulty, her face becoming flushed.</p>

<p>"How art&mdash;how are you?" He did not know whether
to "thou" her or not, and became as red in the face as she
was.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> "Are you well?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>"Very well. Your aunt sent you your favorite soap,
rose-scented," she said, placing the soap on the table, and
the towels on the arms of the chair.</p>

<p>"The gentleman has his own," Timon stood up for the
independence of the guest, proudly pointing to the open
traveling bag with silver lids, containing a large number
of bottles, brushes, perfumes and all sorts of toilet articles.</p>

<p>"My thanks to auntie. But how glad I am that I came,"
said Nekhludoff, feeling the old brightness and emotions
recurring to his soul.</p>

<p>In answer to this she only smiled and left the room.</p>

<p>The aunts, who always loved Nekhludoff, received him
this time with greater joy than usual. Dmitri was going
to active service, where he might be wounded or killed.
This affected the aunts.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff had arranged his trip so that he might spend
twenty-four hours with his aunts, but, seeing Katiousha,
decided to remain over Easter Sunday, which was two
days later, and wired to his friend and commander Shenbok,
whom he was to meet at Odessa, to come to his aunts.</p>

<p>From the very first day Nekhludoff experienced the old
feeling toward Katiousha. Again he could not see without
agitation the white apron of Katiousha; he could not
listen without joy to her steps, her voice, her laugh; he
could not, without emotion, look into her black eyes, especially
when she smiled; he could not, above all, see,
without confusion, how she blushed when they met. He
felt that he was in love, but not as formerly, when this
love was to him a mystery, and he had not the courage to
confess it to himself; when he was convinced that one
can love only once. Now he loved knowingly, rejoiced at
it, and confusedly knowing, though he concealed it from
himself, what it consisted of, and what might come of it.</p>

<p>In Nekhludoff, as in all people, there were two beings;
one spiritual, who sought only such happiness for himself
as also benefited others; and the animal being, seeking his
own happiness for the sake of which he is willing to sacrifice
that of the world. During this period of his insane
egotism, called forth by the life in the army and in St.
Petersburg, the animal man dominated him and completely
suppressed the spiritual man. But, seeing Katiousha, and
being again imbued with the feelings he formerly experienced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>toward her, the spiritual man raised his head and
began to assert his rights. And during the two days preceding
Easter an incessant struggle was going on within
Nekhludoff of which he was quite unconscious.</p>

<p>In the depth of his soul he knew that he had to depart;
that his stay at his aunts was unnecessary, that nothing
good could come of it, but it was so joyous and pleasant
that he did not heed it, and remained.</p>

<p>On the eve of Easter Sunday, the priest and deacon
who, as they afterward related, with difficulty covered the
three miles from the church to the aunts' manor, arrived
on a sleigh to perform the morning services.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff, with his aunts and the servants, went
through the motions, without ceasing to look on Katiousha,
who brought a censer and was standing at the door; then,
in the customary fashion, kissed the priest and the aunts,
and was about to retire to his room when he heard Matriena
Pavlovna, the old servant of Maria Ivanovna, making
preparations with Katiousha to go to church and witness
the consecration of the paschal bread. "I will go
there, too," he thought.</p>

<p>There was no wagon or sleigh road to the church, so
Nekhludoff gave command, as he would in his own house,
to have a horse saddled, and, instead of going to bed,
donned a brilliant uniform and tight knee-breeches, threw
on his military coat, and, mounting the snorting and constantly
neighing, heavy stallion, he drove off to the church
in the dark, over pools and snow mounds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>That morning service formed the brightest and most
impressive reminiscence of Nekhludoff's after life.</p>

<p>The darkness of the night was only relieved here and
there by white patches of snow, and as the stallion, splashing
through the mud-pools, and his ears pricked up at the
sight of the fire-pots surrounding the church, entered its
inclosure, the service had already begun.</p>

<p>The peasants, recognizing Maria Ivanovna's nephew,
led his horse to the driest spot, where he dismounted,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>then they escorted him to the church filled with a holiday
crowd.</p>

<p>To the right were the male peasants; old men in homespun
coats and bast shoes, and young men in new cloth
caftans, bright-colored belts and boots. To the left the
women, with red silk 'kerchiefs on their heads, shag caftans
with bright red sleeves, and blue, green, red, striped
and dotted skirts and iron-heeled shoes. Behind them
stood the more modest women in white 'kerchiefs and gray
caftans and ancient skirts, in shoes or bast slippers.
Among these and the others were dressed-up children with
oiled hair. The peasants made the sign of the cross and
bowed, disheveling their hair; the women, especially the
old women, gazing with their lustreless eyes on one image,
before which candles burned, pressed hard with the tips
of their fingers on the 'kerchief of the forehead, the shoulders
and the abdomen, and, mumbling something, bent
forward standing, or fell on their knees. The children,
imitating their elders, prayed fervently when they were
looked at. The gold iconostasis was aflame with innumerable
candles, which surrounded a large one in the centre
wound in a narrow strip of gilt paper. The church lustre
was dotted with candles, joyful melodies of volunteer singers
with roaring bass and piercing contralto mingled with
the chant of the choir.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff went forward. In the middle of the church
stood the aristocracy; a country squire with his wife and
son in a sailor blouse, the commissary of the rural police,
a telegraph operator, a merchant in high boots, the local
syndic with a medal on his breast, and to the right of the
tribune, behind the squire's wife, Matriena Pavlovna, in
a lilac-colored chatoyant dress and white shawl with colored
border, and beside her was Katiousha in a white
dress, gathered in folds at the waist, a blue belt, and a red
bow in her black hair.</p>

<p>Everything was solemn, joyous and beautiful; the priest
in his bright, silver chasuble, dotted with gilt crosses, the
deacon, the chanters in holiday surplice of gold and silver,
the spruce volunteer singers with oiled hair, the joyous
melodies of holiday songs, the ceaseless blessing of the
throng by the priests with flower-bedecked tern candles
with the constantly repeated exclamations: "Christ has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>risen! Christ has risen!" Everything was beautiful, but
more beautiful than all was Katiousha, in her white dress,
blue belt and red bow in her hair, and her eyes radiant with
delight.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff felt that she saw him without turning
round. He saw it while passing near her to the altar. He
had nothing to tell her, but tried to think of something,
and said, when passing her:</p>

<p>"Auntie said that she would receive the sacrament after
mass."</p>

<p>Her young blood, as it always happened when she
looked at him, rose to her cheeks, and her black eyes,
naively looking up, fixed themselves on Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I know it," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>At that moment a chanter with a copper coffee-pot in
his hand passed close to Katiousha, and, without looking
at her, grazed her with the skirt of the surplice. The
chanter, evidently out of respect for Nekhludoff, wished to
sweep around him, and thus it happened that he grazed
Katiousha.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff, however, was surprised that that chanter
did not understand that everything in the church, and in
the whole world, for that matter, existed only for Katiousha,
and that one might spurn the entire world, but must
not slight her, because she was the centre of it. It was for
her that the gold iconostasis shone brightly, and these
candles in the church-lustre burned; for her were the joyful
chants: "Be happy, man; it is the Lord's Easter." All
the good in the world was for her. And it seemed to him
that Katiousha understood that all this was for her. It
seemed to Nekhludoff, when he looked at her erect figure
in the white dress with little folds at the waist, and by the
expression of her happy face, that the very thing that
filled his soul with song, also filled hers.</p>

<p>In the interval between early and late mass Nekhludoff
left the church. The people made way for him and
bowed. Some recognized him; others asked: "Who is
he?" He stopped at the porch. Beggars surrounded
him, and, distributing such change as he had in his
pocket, he descended the stairs.</p>

<p>The day began to break, but the sun was yet beyond the
horizon. The people seated themselves on the grass
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>around the church-yard, but Katiousha remained in the
church, and Nekhludoff waited on the porch for her appearance.</p>

<p>The crowd was still pouring out of the church, their
hob-nailed shoes clattering against the stone pavement,
and spread about the cemetery.</p>

<p>An old man, confectioner to Maria Ivanovna, stopped
Nekhludoff and kissed him, and his wife, an old woman
with a wrinkled Adam's apple under a silk 'kerchief, unrolled
a yellow saffron egg from her handkerchief and
gave it to him. At the same time a young, smiling and
muscular peasant, in a new caftan, approached.</p>

<p>"Christ has risen!" he said, with smiling eyes and,
nearing Nekhludoff, spread around him a peculiar, pleasant,
peasant odor, and, tickling him with his curly beard,
three times kissed him on the lips.</p>

<p>While Nekhludoff was thus exchanging the customary
kisses with the peasant and taking from him a dark-brown
egg, he noticed the chatoyant dress of Matriena Pavlovna
and the lovely head with the red bow.</p>

<p>No sooner did she catch sight of him over the heads of
those in front of her, than her face brightened up.</p>

<p>On reaching the porch they also stopped, distributing
alms. One of the beggars, with a red, cicatrized slough
instead of a nose, approached Katiousha. She produced
some coins from her handkerchief, gave them to him, and
without the slightest expression of disgust, but, on the
contrary, her eyes beaming with delight, kissed him three
times. While she was thus kissing with the beggar, her
eyes met those of Nekhludoff, and she seemed to ask him:
"Is it not right? Is it not proper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, darling; it is right; everything is beautiful.
I love you."</p>

<p>As they descended the stairs he came near her. He
did not wish to kiss her, but merely wished to be by her
side.</p>

<p>"Christ has risen!" said Matriena Pavlovna, leaning her
head forward and smiling. By the intonation of her voice
she seemed to say, "All are equal to-day," and wiping her
mouth with a bandana handkerchief which she kept under
her arm-pit, she extended her lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>"He has risen, indeed," answered Nekhludoff, and they
kissed each other.</p>

<p>He turned to look at Katiousha. She flushed and at
the same moment approached him.</p>

<p>"Christ has risen, Dmitri Ivanovich."</p>

<p>"He has risen, indeed," he said. They kissed each
other twice, and seemed to be reflecting whether or not
it was necessary to kiss a third time, and having decided,
as it were, that it was necessary, they kissed again.</p>

<p>"Will you go to the priest?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"No, we will stay here, Dmitri Ivanovich," answered
Katiousha, laboriously, as though after hard, pleasant exertion,
breathing with her full breast and looking straight
in his eyes, with her submissive, chaste, loving and slightly
squinting eyes.</p>

<p>There is a point in the love between man and woman
when that love reaches its zenith; when it is free from
consciousness, reason and sensuality. Such a moment
arrived for Nekhludoff that Easter morn.</p>

<p>Now, whenever he thought of Katiousha, her appearance
at that moment obscured every other recollection of
her. The dark, smooth, resplendent head; the white
dress with folds clinging to her graceful bust and undulating
breast; those vermilion cheeks, those brilliant black
eyes, and two main traits in all her being: the virgin purity
of her love, not only for himself, but for everything and
everybody&mdash;he knew it&mdash;not only the good and beautiful,
but even that beggar whom she had kissed.</p>

<p>He knew that she possessed that love, because that night
and that morning he felt it within him, and felt that in
that love his soul mingled into one with hers.</p>

<p>Ah, if that feeling had continued unchanged! "Yes,
that awful affair occurred after that notable commemoration
of Christ's resurrection!" he thought now, sitting at
the window of the jury-room.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>Returning from the church, Nekhludoff broke his fast
with the aunts, and to repair his strength, drank some
brandy and wine&mdash;a habit he acquired in the army&mdash;and
going to his room immediately fell asleep with his clothes
on. He was awakened by a rap at the door. By the rap
he knew that it was she, so he rose, rubbing his eyes and
stretching himself.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Katiousha? Come in," he said, rising.</p>

<p>She opened the door.</p>

<p>"You are wanted to breakfast," she said. She was in
the same white dress, but without the bow in her hair.</p>

<p>As she looked in his eyes she brightened up, as if she
had announced something unusually pleasant.</p>

<p>"I shall come immediately," he answered, taking a comb
to rearrange his hair.</p>

<p>She lingered for a moment. He noticed it, and putting
down the comb, he moved toward her. But at the same
moment she quickly turned and walked off with her customary
light and agile step along the narrow mat of the
corridor.</p>

<p>"What a fool I am!" Nekhludoff said to himself. "Why
did I not detain her?" And he ran after her.</p>

<p>He did not know himself what he wished of her, but it
seemed to him that when she entered his room he ought to
have done something that any one in his place would have
done, but which he failed to do.</p>

<p>"Wait, Katiousha," he said.</p>

<p>She looked around.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said, stopping.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With some effort he overcame his shyness, and remembering
how people generally act in such a case, he put his
arm about Katiousha's waist.</p>

<p>She stopped and looked in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't, Ivanovich, don't," she said, blushing until her
eyes filled with tears. Then with her rough, strong hands
she removed his arm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>Nekhludoff released her, and for a moment felt not only
awkward and ashamed, but seemed odious to himself.
He should have believed in himself, but he failed to understand
that this awkwardness and shame were the noblest
feelings of his soul begging for recognition, and, on the
contrary, it seemed to him that it was his foolishness that
was speaking within him, that he ought to have done as
everybody does in a similar case.</p>

<p>He overtook her again, again embraced her and kissed
her on the neck. This kiss was entirely unlike the other
two kisses. The first was given unconsciously, behind the
lilac bush; the second, in the morning in church. The
last one was terrible, and she felt it.</p>

<p>"But what are you doing?" she exclaimed in such a
voice, as if he had irrecoverably destroyed something infinitely
precious, and ran away from him.</p>

<p>He went to the dining-room. His aunts in holiday attire,
the doctor and a neighbor were taking lunch standing.
Everything was as usual, but a storm raged in
Nekhludoff's soul. He did not understand what was said
to him, his answers were inappropriate, and he was thinking
only of Katiousha, recalling the sensation of the last
kiss he gave her when he overtook her in the corridor.
He could think of nothing else. When she entered the
room, without looking at her, he felt her presence with all
his being, and had to make an effort not to look at her.</p>

<p>After lunch he went immediately to his room, and in
great agitation walked to and fro, listening to the sounds
in the house and waiting to hear her steps. The animal
man that dwelled in him not only raised his head, but
crushed under foot the spiritual man that he was when he
first arrived at the manor, and was even this very morning
in church, and that terrible animal man now held sway
in his soul. Although Nekhludoff was watching an opportunity
to meet Katiousha that day, he did not succeed
in seeing her face to face even once. She was probably
avoiding him. But in the evening it happened that she
had to enter a room adjoining his. The physician was to
remain over night, and Katiousha had to make the bed for
him. Hearing her steps, Nekhludoff, stepping on tip-toe
and holding his breath, as though preparing to commit a
crime, followed her into the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>Thrusting both her hands into a white pillow-case, and
taking hold of two corners of the pillow, she turned her
head and looked at him smiling, but it was not the old,
cheerful, happy smile, but a frightened, piteous smile.
The smile seemed to tell him that what he was doing was
wrong. For a moment he stood still. There was still the
possibility of a struggle. Though weak, the voice of his
true love to her was still heard; it spoke of her, of her
feelings, of her life. The other voice reminded him of
his enjoyment, his happiness. And this second voice
stifled the first. He approached her with determination.
And the terrible, irresistible animal feeling mastered him.</p>

<p>Without releasing her from his embrace, Nekhludoff
seated her on the bed, and feeling that something else
ought to be done, seated himself beside her.</p>

<p>"Dmitri Ivanovich, darling, please let me go," she said
in a piteous voice. "Matriena Pavlovna is coming!" she
suddenly exclaimed, tearing herself away.</p>

<p>Matriena Pavlovna was really approaching the door.
She entered the room, holding a quilt on her arm, and,
looking reproachfully at Nekhludoff, angrily rebuked
Katiousha for taking the wrong quilt.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff went out in silence. He was not even
ashamed. By the expression of Matriena Pavlovna's face
he saw that she condemned him, and justly so; he knew
that what he was doing was wrong, but the animal feeling,
which succeeded his former feeling of pure love to her,
seized him and held sole sway over him; recognizing no
other feeling. He knew now what was necessary to do
in order to satisfy that feeling, and was looking for means
to that end.</p>

<p>He was out of sorts all that night. Now he would go
to his aunts; now he returned to his room, or went to the
perron, thinking but of one thing: how to meet her alone.
But she avoided him, and Matriena Pavlovna strove not to
lose sight of her.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>Thus the entire evening passed, and when night came
the doctor went to bed. The aunts were also preparing
to retire. Nekhludoff knew that Matriena Pavlovna was
in the aunts' dormitory, and that Katiousha was in the
servants' quarters&mdash;alone. He again went out on the perron.
It was dark, damp and warm, and that white mist
which in the spring thaws the last snow, filled the air.
Strange noises came from the river, which was a hundred
feet from the house. It was the breaking up of the ice.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff came down from the perron, and stepping
over pools and the thin ice-covering formed on the snow,
walked toward the window of the servants' quarters. His
heart beat so violently that he could hear it; his breathing
at times stopped, at others it escaped in a heavy sigh. A
small lamp was burning in the maid-servants' room.</p>

<p>Katiousha was sitting at the table alone, musing and
looking at the wall before her. Without moving Nekhludoff
for some time stood gazing at her, wishing to know
what she would do while thinking herself unobserved.
For about two minutes she sat motionless, then raised her
eyes, smiled, reproachfully shook her head, at herself apparently,
and, changing her position, with a start placed
both hands on the table and fixed her eyes before her.</p>

<p>He remained looking at her, and involuntarily listened
to the beating of his heart and the strange sounds coming
from the river. There, on the misty river some incessant,
slow work was going on. Now something snuffled, then
it crackled, and again the thin layer of ice resounded like
a mass of crushed glass.</p>

<p>He stood looking at the thoughtful face of Katiousha,
tormented by an internal struggle, and he pitied her.
But, strange to say, this pity only increased his longing
for her.</p>

<p>He rapped at the window. She trembled from head to
foot, as if an electric current had passed through her, and
terror was reflected on her face. Then she sprang up,
and, going to the window, placed her face against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>window-pane. The expression of terror did not leave her
even when, shading her eyes with the palms of her hands,
she recognized him. Her face was unusually grave&mdash;he
had never seen such an expression on it. When he smiled
she smiled also&mdash;she smiled as if only in submission to
him, but in her soul, instead of a smile, there was terror.
He motioned her with his hand to come out. But she
shook her head and remained at the window. Again he
leaned toward the window and was about to speak when
she turned toward the door. Some one had apparently
called her. Nekhludoff moved away from the window.
The fog was so dense that when five feet away he saw
only a darkening mass from which a red, seemingly large,
light of the lamp was reflected. From the river came the
same strange sounds of snuffling, crackling and grinding
of the ice. In the court-yard a cock crowed, others near
by responded; then from the village, first singly, interrupting
each other, then mingling into one chorus, was
heard the crowing of all the cocks. Except for the noise
of the river, it was perfectly quiet all around.</p>

<p>After walking twice around the corner of the house,
and stepping several times into mud-pools, Nekhludoff
returned to the window of the maid-servants' quarters.
The lamp was still burning, and Katiousha sat alone at the
table as if in indecision. As soon as he came near the
window she looked at him. He rapped. Without stopping
to see who had rapped, she immediately ran from
the room, and he heard the opening and closing of the
door. He was already waiting for her in the passage,
and immediately silently embraced her. She pressed
against his bosom, lifted her head, and with her lips met
his kiss.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When Nekhludoff returned to his room it was getting
brighter. Below, the noises on the river increased, and a
buzzing was added to the other sounds. The mist began
to settle, and from behind the wall of mist the waning
moon appeared, gloomily, lighting up something dark and
terrible.</p>

<p>"Is it good fortune or a great misfortune that has happened
to me?" he asked himself. "It is always thus; they
all act in that way," and he returned to his room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>On the following day the brilliant and jovial Shenbok
called at the aunts for Nekhludoff, and completely
charmed them with his elegance, amiability, cheerfulness,
liberality, and his love for Dmitri. Though his liberality
pleased the aunts, they were somewhat perplexed by the
excess to which he carried it. He gave a ruble to a blind
beggar; the servants received as tips fifteen rubles, and
when Sophia Ivanovna's lap-dog, Suzette, hurt her leg so
that it bled, he volunteered to bandage it, and without a
moment's consideration tore his fine linen handkerchief
(Sophia Ivanovna knew that those handkerchiefs were
worth fifteen rubles a dozen) and made bandages of it for
the dog. The aunts had never seen such men, nor did
they know that his debts ran up to two hundred thousand
rubles, which&mdash;he knew&mdash;would never be paid, and that
therefore twenty-five rubles more or less made no appreciable
difference in his accounts.</p>

<p>Shenbok remained but one day, and the following evening
departed with Nekhludoff. They could remain no
longer, for the time for joining their regiment had arrived.</p>

<p>On this last day spent at the aunts, when the events of
the preceding evening were fresh in his memory, two antagonistic
feelings struggled in Nekhludoff's soul; one
was the burning, sensual recollection of love, although it
failed to fulfill its promises, and some satisfaction of having
gained his ends; the other, a consciousness of having
committed a wrong, and that that wrong must be righted&mdash;not
for her sake, but for his own sake.</p>

<p>In that condition of insane egotism Nekhludoff thought
only of himself&mdash;whether he would be condemned, and
how far, if his act should be discovered, but never gave a
thought to the question, "How does she feel about it, and
what will become of her?"</p>

<p>He thought that Shenbok divined his relations to
Katiousha, and his ambition was flattered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>"That's why you so suddenly began to like your aunts,"
Shenbok said to him when he saw Katiousha. "In your
place I should stay here even longer. She is charming!"</p>

<p>He also thought that while it was a pity to leave now,
without enjoying his love in its fullness, the necessity of
going was advantageous in that he was able to break the
relations which it were difficult to keep up. He further
thought it was necessary to give her money, not because
she might need it, but because it was customary to do so.
So he gave as much money as he thought was proper,
considering their respective positions.</p>

<p>On the day of his departure, after dinner he waited in
the passage until she came by. She flushed as she saw
him, and wished to pass on, pointing with her eyes to the
door of her room, but he detained her.</p>

<p>"I came to bid you farewell," he said, crumpling an
envelope containing a hundred ruble bill. "How is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She suspected it, frowned, shook her head and thrust
aside his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, take it," he murmured, thrusting the envelope in
the bosom of her waist, and, as if it had burned his fingers,
he ran to his room.</p>

<p>For a long time he paced his room to and fro, frowning,
and even jumping, and moaning aloud as if from physical
pain, as he thought of the scene.</p>

<p>But what is to be done? It is always thus. Thus it
was with Shenbok and the governess whom he had told
about; it was thus with Uncle Gregory; with his father,
when he lived in the country, and the illegitimate son
Miteuka, who is still living, was born to him. And if
everybody acts thus, consequently it ought to be so. Thus
he was consoling himself, but he could not be consoled.
The recollection of it stung his conscience.</p>

<p>In the depth of his soul he knew that his action was so
base, abominable and cruel that, with that action upon
his conscience, not only would he have no right to condemn
others but he should not be able to look others in
the face, to say nothing of considering himself the good,
noble, magnanimous man he esteemed himself. And he
had to esteem himself as such in order to be able to continue
to lead a valiant and joyous life. And there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>but one way of doing so, and that was not to think of it.
This he endeavored to do.</p>

<p>The life into which he had just entered&mdash;new scenes,
comrades, and active service&mdash;helped him on. The more
he lived, the less he thought of it, and in the end really
forgot it entirely.</p>

<p>Only once, on his return from active service, when, in
the hope of seeing her, he paid a visit to his aunts, he was
told that Katiousha, soon after his departure, had left
them; that she had given birth to a child, and, as the
aunts were informed, had gone to the bad. As he heard
it his heart was oppressed with grief. From the statement
of the time when she gave birth to the child it might be
his, and it might not be his. The aunts said that she was
vicious and of a depraved nature, just like her mother.
And this opinion of the aunts pleased him, because it exculpated
him, as it were. At first he intended to find her
and the child, but as it pained him very much, and he was
ashamed to think of it, he did not make the necessary
efforts, and gradually ceased to think of his sin.</p>

<p>But now, this fortuitous meeting brought everything
to his mind, and compelled the acknowledgment of his
heartlessness, cruelty and baseness which made it possible
for him to live undisturbed by the sin which lay on his
conscience. He was yet far from such acknowledgment,
and at this moment was only thinking how to avoid disclosure
which might be made by her, or her attorney, and
thus disgrace him before everybody.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff was in this state of mind when he left the
court-room and entered the jury-room. He sat near the
window, listening to the conversations of his fellow jurymen,
and smoked incessantly.</p>

<p>The cheerful merchant evidently sympathized with
Merchant Smelkoff's manner of passing his time.</p>

<p>"Well, well! He went on his spree just like a Siberian!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>Seems to have known a good thing when he saw it. What
a beauty!"</p>

<p>The foreman expressed the opinion that the whole case
depended on the expert evidence. Peter Gerasimovich
was jesting with the Jewish clerk, and both of them burst
out laughing. Nekhludoff answered all questions in
monosyllables, and only wished to be left in peace.</p>

<p>When the usher with the sidling gait called the jury
into court Nekhludoff was seized with fear, as if judgment
was to be passed on him, and not he to pass judgment
on others.</p>

<p>In the depth of his soul he already felt that he was a
rascal, who ought to be ashamed to look people in the
face, and yet, by force of habit, he walked to the elevation
with his customary air of self-confidence, and took his seat
next to the foreman, crossed his legs and began to play
with his pince-nez.</p>

<p>The prisoners, who had also been removed from the
court, were brought in again.</p>

<p>The new faces of witnesses were now seen in the court-room,
and Nekhludoff noticed Maslova constantly turning
her head in the direction of a smartly attired, stout woman
in silk and plush, with an elegant reticule hanging on her
half-bare arm. This was, as Nekhludoff afterward
learned, Maslova's mistress and a witness against her.</p>

<p>The examination of the witnesses began as to their
names, age, religion, et cetera. After being questioned
as to whether they preferred to testify under oath, the
same old priest, with difficulty moving his legs, came, and
again arranging the gold cross on his silk-covered breast,
with the same calmness and confidence, began to administer
the oath to the witnesses and the expert. When the
swearing in was over, the witnesses were removed to an
adjoining room, leaving only Kitaeva, Maslova's mistress.
She was asked what she knew of the affair. Kitaeva,
with a feigned smile, a German accent, and straightening
her hat at every sentence, fluently and circumstantially related
the following:</p>

<p>Simon came first to her house for Liubasha.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> In a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>while Liubasha returned with the merchant. "The merchant
was already in ecstasy," slightly smiling, said
Kitaeva, "and he continued to drink and treat himself, but
as he was short of money he sent to his room this same
Liubasha, for whom he acquired a predilection," she said,
looking at Maslova.</p>

<p>It seemed to Nekhludoff that Maslova smiled at this,
and the smile seemed to him disgusting. A strange
feeling of squeamishness mingled with compassion rose in
his breast.</p>

<p>"What opinion did you entertain of Maslova?" timidly
and blushingly asked the attorney assigned by the court
to defend Maslova.</p>

<p>"Very excellent," answered Kitaeva. "The girl is very
well educated and elegant in her manners. She was
raised in a very good family, and could read French. She
sometimes drank a little too much, but she never forgot
herself. She is a very good girl."</p>

<p>Katiousha looked at her mistress, then suddenly turned
her eyes on the jury and rested them on Nekhludoff, her
face becoming serious and even stern. One of the stern
eyes squinted. These strangely gazing eyes were turned
on Nekhludoff for a considerable time. Notwithstanding
the terror that seized him, he could not remove his own
gaze from those squinting eyes with their shining whites.
He recalled that awful night with the breaking ice, the
fog, and especially that waning, upturned moon which
rose in the morning and lit up something dark and terrible.
These two black eyes which looked at and at the
same time by him reminded him of something dark and
terrible.</p>

<p>"She recognized me!" he thought. And Nekhludoff
shrank, as it were, waiting for the blow. But she did
not recognize him. She sighed calmly and again fixed
her eyes on the justiciary. Nekhludoff also sighed.
"Ah, if they would only hasten it through," he thought.
He felt now as he did once when out game shooting, when
he was obliged to kill a wounded bird&mdash;he was filled with
disgust, pity and vexation. The wounded bird is struggling
in the game bag; he feels disgust and pity, and
wishes to kill it quickly and forget it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Such mingled feelings filled Nekhludoff's breast as he
sat listening to the examination of the witnesses.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>As if to spite him, the case dragged out to a weary
length. After the examination of the witnesses and the
expert, and after all the unnecessary questions by the
prosecutor and the attorneys, usually made with an important
air, the justiciary told the jury to look at the exhibits,
which consisted of an enormous ring with a diamond
rosette, evidently made for the forefinger, and a
glass tube containing the poison. These were sealed and
labeled.</p>

<p>The jury were preparing to view these things, when
the prosecutor rose again and demanded that before the
exhibits were examined the medical report of the condition
of the body be read.</p>

<p>The justiciary was hurrying the case, and though he
knew that the reading of the report would only bring
ennui and delay the dinner, and that the prosecutor demanded
it only because he had the right to do so, he could
not refuse the request and gave his consent. The secretary
produced the report, and, lisping the letters l and r,
began to read in a sad voice.</p>

<p>The external examination disclosed:</p>

<p>1. The height of Therapout Smelkoff was six feet five
inches.</p>

<p>"But what a huge fellow," the merchant whispered
in Nekhludoff's ear with solicitude.</p>

<p>2. From external appearances he seemed to be about
forty years of age.</p>

<p>3. The body had a swollen appearance.</p>

<p>4. The color of the pall was green, streaked with dark
spots.</p>

<p>5. The skin on the surface of the body rose in bubbles
of various sizes, and in places hung in patches.</p>

<p>6. The hair was dark and thick, and fell off at a slight
touch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>7. The eyes came out of their orbits, and the pupils
were dull.</p>

<p>8. A frothy, serous fluid flowed continuously from the
cavity of the mouth, the nostrils and ears. The mouth
was half open.</p>

<p>9. The neck almost disappeared in the swelling of the
face and breast, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>Thus, over four pages and twenty-seven clauses, ran
the description of the external appearance of the terrible,
large, stout, swollen and decomposing body of the merchant
who amused himself in the city. The loathing
which Nekhludoff felt increased with the reading of the
description. Katiousha's life, the sanies running from the
nostrils, the eyes that came out of their sockets, and his
conduct toward her&mdash;all seemed to him to belong to the
same order, and he was surrounded and swallowed up by
these things. When the reading was finally over, the
justiciary sighed deeply and raised his head in the hope
that it was all over, but the secretary immediately began
to read the report on the internal condition of the body.</p>

<p>The justiciary again bent his head, and, leaning on his
hand, closed his eyes. The merchant, who sat near Nekhludoff,
barely kept awake, and from time to time swayed
his body. The prisoners as well as the gendarmes behind
them sat motionless.</p>

<p>The internal examination disclosed:</p>

<p>1. The skin covering of the skull easily detached, and
no hemorrhage was noticeable. 2. The skull bones were
of average thickness and uninjured. 3. On the hard
membrane of the skull there were two small discolored
spots of about the size of four centimetres, the membrane
itself being of a dull gray color, et cetera, et cetera, to the
end of thirteen more clauses.</p>

<p>Then came the names of the witnesses, the signature
and deduction of the physician, from which it appeared
that the changes found in the stomach, intestines and kidneys
justified the conclusion "to a large degree probable"
that the death of Smelkoff was due to poison taken into
the stomach with a quantity of wine. That it was impossible
to tell by the changes in the stomach and intestines
the name of the poison; and that the poison came into the
stomach mixed with wine could be inferred from the fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>that Smelkoff's stomach contained a large quantity of
wine.</p>

<p>"He must have drank like a fish," again whispered the
awakened merchant.</p>

<p>The reading of this official report, which lasted about
two hours, did not satisfy, however, the prosecutor.
When it was over the justiciary turned to him, saying:</p>

<p>"I suppose it is superfluous to read the record of the
examination of the intestines."</p>

<p>"I would ask that it be read," sternly said the prosecutor
without looking at the justiciary, sidewise raising himself,
and impressing by the tone of his voice that it was
his right to demand it, that he would insist on it, and that
a refusal would be ground for appeal.</p>

<p>The associate with the long beard and kind, drooping
eyes, who was suffering from catarrh, feeling very weak,
turned to the justiciary:</p>

<p>"What is the good of reading it? It will only drag the
matter out. These new brooms only take a longer time
to sweep, but do not sweep any cleaner."</p>

<p>The associate in the gold eye-glasses said nothing, and
gloomily and determinedly looked in front of him, expecting
nothing good either from his wife or from the
world.</p>

<p>The report commenced thus: "February 15th, 188&mdash;.
The undersigned, in pursuance of an order, No. 638, of
the Medical Department," began the secretary with resolution,
raising the pitch of his voice, as if to dispel the
drowsiness that seized upon every one present, "and in
the presence of the assistant medical director, examined
the following intestines:</p>

<p>"1. The right lung and heart (contained in a five-pound
glass vial).</p>

<p>"2. The contents of the stomach (contained in a five-pound
glass vial).</p>

<p>"3. The stomach itself (contained in a five-pound glass
vial).</p>

<p>"4. The kidneys, liver and spleen (contained in a two-and-a-half-pound
glass vial).</p>

<p>"5. The entrails (contained in a five-pound earthen
jar)."</p>

<p>As the reading of this report began the justiciary leaned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>over to one of his associates and whispered something,
then to the other, and, receiving affirmative answers, interrupted
the reading at this point.</p>

<p>"The Court finds the reading of the report superfluous,"
he said.</p>

<p>The secretary closed reading and gathered up his
papers, while the prosecutor angrily began to make notes.</p>

<p>"The gentlemen of the jury may now view the exhibits,"
said the justiciary.</p>

<p>The foreman and some of the jury rose from their
seats, and, holding their hands in awkward positions, approached
the table and looked in turn on the ring, vials
and jars. The merchant even tried the ring on his finger.</p>

<p>"What a finger he had," he said, returning to his seat.
"It must have been the size of a large cucumber," he
added, evidently amused by the giant figure of the merchant,
as he imagined him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>When the examination of the exhibits was over, the
justiciary announced the investigation closed, and, desiring
to end the session, gave the word to the prosecutor,
in the hope that as he, too, was mortal, he might also wish
to smoke or dine, and would have pity on the others. But
the prosecutor pitied neither himself nor them. When
the word was given him, he rose slowly, displaying his
elegant figure, and, placing both hands on the desk, and
slightly bending his head, he cast a glance around the
court-room, his eyes avoiding the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, the case which is now to be
submitted to your consideration," he began his speech,
prepared while the indictment and reports were being
read, "is a characteristic crime, if I may so express myself."</p>

<p>The speech of a prosecuting attorney, according to his
idea, had to be invested with a social significance, according
to the manner of those lawyers who became famous.
True, among his hearers were three women; a seamstress,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>a cook and Simon's sister, also a driver, but that made no
difference. Those celebrities also began on a small scale.
The prosecutor made it a rule to view the situation from
the eminence of his position, i.&nbsp;e., to penetrate into the
profound psychological meaning of crime, and bare the
ulcers of society.</p>

<p>"Here is before you, gentlemen of the jury, a crime
characteristic, if I may so express myself, of the end of
our century, bearing, as it were, all the specific features
of the first symptoms of decomposition, to which those
elements of our society, which are exposed, as it were, to
the more scorching rays of that process, are subject."</p>

<p>The prosecutor spoke at great length, endeavoring on
the one hand to remember all those wise sayings which
he had prepared for the occasion, and on the other, most
important, hand, not to stop for a moment, but to make
his speech flow uninterruptedly for an hour and a quarter.
He stopped only once, for a long time swallowing
his saliva, but he immediately mastered himself and made
up for the lost time by a greater flow of eloquence. He
spoke in a gentle, insinuating voice, resting now on one
foot, now on the other, and looking at the jury; then
changed to a calm, business tone, consulting his note-book,
and again he thundered accusations, turning now
to the spectators, now to the jury. But he never looked
at the prisoners, all three of whom stared at him. He
incorporated into his speech all the latest ideas then in
vogue in the circle of his acquaintances, and what was
then and is now received as the last word of scientific
wisdom. He spoke of heredity, of innate criminality, of
Lombroso, of Charcot, of evolution, of the struggle for
existence, of hypnotism, of hypnotic suggestion, and of
decadence.</p>

<p>The merchant Smelkoff, according to the prosecutor,
was a type of the great, pure Russian, with his broad
nature, who, in consequence of his trusting nature and
generosity, had become a victim of a gang of corrupt
people, into whose hands he had fallen.</p>

<p>Simon Kartinkin was the atavistic production of serfdom,
stupid, without education, and even without religion.
Euphemia was his mistress, and a victim of heredity. All
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>the symptoms of degenerate life were in her. But the
ruling spirit in this crime was Maslova, who was the
mouthpiece of the lowest phenomenon of decadence.
"This woman," said the prosecutor without looking at
her, "received an education&mdash;you have heard here the evidence
of her mistress. Not only can she read and write,
but she can speak French. She is an orphan, and probably
bears the germs of criminality in her. She was
raised in an intelligent, noble family, and could make her
living by honest toil, but she leaves them, yields to her
passions, and displays an intelligence, and especially, as
you have heard here, gentlemen of the jury, an ability to
exert influence on people by that mysterious, lately discovered
by science, especially by the school of Charcot,
power known by the name of hypnotic suggestion. By
the aid of this power she gets control over this hero&mdash;a
kind, trustful, rich guest, and uses his confidence first to
rob him, and then to pitilessly murder him."</p>

<p>"But he is wandering away," said the justiciary, smiling
and leaning over to the stern associate.</p>

<p>"What an awful blockhead!" said the stern associate.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury!" the prosecutor continued
meanwhile, gracefully swaying his slim body. "The fate
of these people is in your hands, as is to some extent
the fate of society, which is influenced by your verdict.
You must fathom the significance of this crime,
the danger to society that lurks in such pathological, as it
were, individuals as Maslova. You must guard it
against infection; it is your duty to guard the innocent,
healthy elements of society against contagion, if not destruction."</p>

<p>And as if himself impressed with the importance of the
verdict, and evidently greatly delighted with his speech,
the prosecutor took his seat.</p>

<p>The burden of his speech, if we eliminate the flights of
eloquence, was to the effect that Maslova, after gaining
the merchant's confidence, hypnotized him, and that, arriving
at the inn with the key to the merchant's trunk,
she intended to steal the money herself, but, being discovered
by Simon and Euphemia, was obliged to divide
with them. That afterward, desiring to conceal the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>traces of her crime, she returned with the merchant to the
inn and administered poison to him.</p>

<p>When the prosecutor had finished his speech, a middle-aged
man, in a dress coat and wide semi-circle of starched
shirt front, rose from the lawyer's bench, and boldly began
to deliver a speech in defense of Kartinkin and Bochkova.
He was a lawyer hired by them for three hundred
rubles. He declared them both innocent, and threw all
the blame on Maslova.</p>

<p>He belittled the deposition of Maslova relating to the
presence of Bochkova and Kartinkin when she took the
money, and insisted that, as she had confessed to poisoning
the merchant, her evidence could have no weight. The
twenty-five hundred rubles could have been earned by two
hard working and honest persons, who were receiving in
tips three to four rubles a day from guests. The merchant's
money was stolen by Maslova, who either gave it
to some one for safe keeping, or lost it, which was not unlikely,
as she was not in a normal condition. The poisoning
was done by Maslova alone.</p>

<p>For these reasons he asked the jury to acquit Kartinkin
and Bochkova of stealing the money; or, if they found
them guilty of stealing he asked for a verdict of theft,
but without participation in the poisoning, and without
conspiracy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this lawyer made a thrust at the prosecuting
attorney by remarking that, although the splendid
reasonings of the prosecutor on heredity explain the scientific
questions of heredity, they hardly hold good in the
case of Bochkova, since her parentage was unknown.</p>

<p>The prosecutor, growling, began to make notes, and
shrugged his shoulders in contemptuous surprise.</p>

<p>Next rose Maslova's lawyer, and timidly and falteringly
began his speech in her defense. Without denying that
Maslova participated in the theft, he insisted that she had
no intention of poisoning Smelkoff, but gave him the
powder in order to make him sleep. When he described
Maslova's unfortunate life, telling how she had been
drawn into a life of vice by a man who went unpunished,
while she was left to bear the whole burden of her fall,
he attempted to become eloquent, but his excursion into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>the domain of psychology failed, so that everybody felt
awkward. When he began to mutter about man's cruelty
and woman's helplessness, the justiciary, desiring to help
him, asked him to confine himself to the facts of the case.</p>

<p>After this lawyer had finished the prosecutor rose
again and defended his position on the question of heredity
against the first lawyer, stating that the fact that
Bochkova's parentage was unknown did not invalidate
the truth of the theory of heredity; that the law of
heredity is so well established by science that not only can
one deduce the crime from heredity, but heredity from
the crime. As to the statement of the defense that Maslova
was drawn into a vicious life by an imaginary (he
pronounced the word imaginary with particular virulence)
man, he could say that all facts rather pointed to
her being the seducer of many victims who were unfortunate
enough to fall into her hands. Saying which he
sat down in triumph.</p>

<p>The prisoners were then allowed to make any statements
they wished in their behalf.</p>

<p>Euphemia Bochkova repeated her statement that she
knew nothing, had not taken part in anything, and persistently
pointed at Maslova as the only guilty person.
Simon only repeated several times:</p>

<p>"Do what you please with me, only it is all for nothing."</p>

<p>Maslova was silent. When asked what she had to say
in her defense, she only lifted her eyes on the justiciary,
looked around like a hunted animal, and immediately
lowering them began to sob aloud.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the merchant of Nekhludoff,
hearing a strange sound escaping the latter's lips.
It was a suppressed sob.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff did not yet realize the significance of his
present position, and the scarcely suppressed sob and the
tears that welled up in his eyes he ascribed to the weakness
of his nerves. He put on his pince-nez to hide them,
and, drawing a handkerchief from his pocket, began to
blow his nose.</p>

<p>His fear of the disgrace that would fall upon him if
everybody in the court-room were to find out his conduct
toward her stifled the struggle that was going on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>within him. At this time fear outweighed in him every
other feeling.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>After the last words of the prisoners had been heard,
and the lengthy arguments over the form in which the
questions were to be put to the jury were over, the questions
were finally agreed upon, and the justiciary began
to deliver his instructions to the jury.</p>

<p>Although he was anxious to finish the case, he was so
carried away that when he started to speak he could not
stop himself. He told the jury at great length that if
they found the prisoners guilty, they had the right to return
a verdict of guilty, and if they found them not guilty,
they had the right to return a verdict of not guilty. If,
however they found them guilty of one charge, and not
guilty of the other, they might bring in a verdict of guilty
of the one and not guilty of the other. He further explained
to them that they must exercise this power intelligently.
He also intended to explain to them that if
they gave an affirmative answer to a question, they would
thereby affirm everything involved in the question, and
that if they did not desire to affirm everything involved in
the question, they must distinguish the part they affirmed
from the part they disaffirmed. But, seeing on the clock
that it was five minutes of three, he decided to pass over
to a statement of the case.</p>

<p>"The facts of this case are the following," he began, repeating
everything that had been stated over and over
again by the defendants' attorneys, the prosecutor and
the witnesses. While the justiciary was charging the
jury his associates thoughtfully listened, and now and
then glanced at the clock. They thought that although
his charge was sound, i.&nbsp;e., as it should be, it was too
long. Of the same opinion was the prosecutor, as well as
all those connected with the court, including the spectators.
The justiciary concluded his charge.</p>

<p>It was thought he had finished. But the justiciary
found it necessary to add a few words concerning the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>importance
of the power given to the jury; that it should be
used with care, and should not be abused; that they had
taken an oath; that they were the conscience of society,
and that the secrecy of the consultation room was sacred,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>From the moment the justiciary began to speak, Maslova
kept her eyes on him, as if she feared to miss a word,
so that Nekhludoff was not afraid to meet her gaze, and
constantly looked at her. And before his imagination
arose that common phenomenon of the appearance of a
long absent, beloved face, which, after the first shock produced
by the external changes which have taken place
during the long absence, gradually becomes the same as it
was many years ago&mdash;all the past changes disappear, and
before the spiritual eyes stands forth the main expression
of the peculiar spiritual individuality. This happened
with Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>Yes, notwithstanding the prison garb, the bloated body
and the high breast; notwithstanding the distended lower
part of the face, the wrinkles on the forehead and the
temples, and the swelling under the eyes, it was undoubtedly
that same Katiousha who on Easter Sunday looked
up to him, her beloved, with her enamored, smiling,
happy, lively eyes.</p>

<p>"What a remarkable coincidence! That this case
should be tried during my term! That, without seeing
her for ten years, I should meet her here in the prisoner's
dock! And what will be the end? Ah, I wish it were
over!"</p>

<p>He would not yield to the feeling of repentance which
spoke within him. He considered it an incident which
would soon pass away without disturbing his life. He
felt himself in the position of a puppy who had misbehaved
in his master's rooms, and whom his master, taking
him by the neck, thrust into the dirt he had made. The
puppy squeals, pulls back in his effort to escape the consequences
of his deed, which he wishes to forget, but the inexorable
master holds him fast. Thus Nekhludoff felt
the foulness of his act, and he also felt the powerful hand
of the master, but did not yet understand the significance
of his act, did not recognize the master. He did not wish
to believe that what he saw before him was the result of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>his own deed. But the inexorable, invisible hand held
him fast, and he had a foreboding that he should not escape.
He summoned up his courage, crossed his legs, as
was his wont, and, negligently playing with his pince-nez,
he sat with an air of self-confidence on the second chair of
the front row. Meanwhile he already felt in the depth of
his soul all the cruelty, dastardliness and baseness not
only of that act of his, but of his whole idle, dissolute,
cruel and wayward life. And the terrible veil, which
during these twelve years in such marvelous manner had
hidden from him that crime and all his subsequent life,
already began to stir, and now and then he caught a
glimpse behind it.</p>

<p>The justiciary finally finished his speech and handed the
list of questions to the foreman. The jury rose from
their seats, glad of an opportunity to leave the court-room,
and, not knowing what to do with their hands, as if
ashamed of something, they filed into the consultation-room.
As soon as the door closed behind them a gendarme,
with drawn sword resting on his shoulder, placed
himself in front of it. The judges rose and went out.
The prisoners also were led away.</p>

<p>On entering the consultation-room the jury immediately
produced cigarettes and began to smoke. The sense of
their unnatural and false position, of which they were to
a greater or less degree cognizant, while sitting in the
court-room, passed away as soon as they entered their
room and lighted their cigarettes, and, with a feeling of
relief, they seated themselves and immediately started an
animated conversation.</p>

<p>"The girl is not guilty, she was confused," said the kind-hearted
merchant.</p>

<p>"That is what we are going to consider," retorted the
foreman. "We must not yield to our personal impressions."</p>

<p>"The judge's summing up was good," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"Do you call it good? It nearly sent me to sleep."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>"The important point is that the servants could not
have known that there was money in the room if Maslova
had no understanding with them," said the clerk with the
Jewish face.</p>

<p>"So you think that she stole it?" asked one of the jury.</p>

<p>"I will never believe that," shouted the kind-hearted
merchant. "It is all the work of that red-eyed wench."</p>

<p>"They are all alike," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"But she said that she did not go into the room."</p>

<p>"Do you believe her more than the other? I should
never believe that worthless woman."</p>

<p>"That does not decide the question," said the clerk.</p>

<p>"She had the key."</p>

<p>"What if she had?" answered the merchant.</p>

<p>"And the ring?"</p>

<p>"She explained it," again shouted the merchant. "It
is quite likely that being drunk he struck her. Well, and
then he was sorry, of course. 'There, don't cry! Take
this ring.' And what a big man! They said he weighed
about two hundred and fifty pounds, I believe."</p>

<p>"That is not the point," interrupted Peter Gerasimovich.
"The question is, Was she the instigator, or were
the servants?"</p>

<p>"The servants could not have done it without her. She
had the key."</p>

<p>This incoherent conversation lasted for a long time.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, gentlemen," said the foreman. "Let us
sit down and consider the matter. Take your seats," he
added, seating himself in the foreman's chair.</p>

<p>"These girls are rogues," said the clerk, and to sustain
his opinion that Maslova was the chief culprit, he related
how one of those girls once stole a watch from a friend
of his.</p>

<p>As a case in point the colonel related the bolder theft
of a silver <i>samovar</i>.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, let us take up the questions," said the foreman,
rapping on the table with a pencil.</p>

<p>They became silent. The questions submitted were:</p>

<p>1. Is the peasant of the village of Barkoff, district of
Krapivensk, Simon Petroff Kartinkin, thirty-three years
of age, guilty of having, with the design of taking the life
of Smelkoff and robbing him, administered to him poison
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>in a glass of brandy, which caused the death of Smelkoff,
and of afterward robbing him of twenty-five hundred
rubles and a diamond ring?</p>

<p>2. Is the burgess Euphemia Ivanovna Bochkova, forty-seven
years of age, guilty of the crime mentioned in the
first question?</p>

<p>3. Is the burgess Katherine <a name="Michaelovna" id="Michaelovna"></a>Michaelovna Maslova, twenty-seven
years of age, guilty of the crime mentioned in the
first question?</p>

<p>4. If the prisoner Euphemia Bochkova is not guilty of
the crime set forth in the first question, is she not guilty
of secretly stealing, while employed in the Hotel Mauritania,
on the 17th day of January, 188&mdash;, twenty-five hundred
rubles from the trunk of the merchant Smelkoff, to
which end she opened the trunk in the hotel with a key
brought and fitted by her?</p>

<p>The foreman read the first question.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, what do you think?"</p>

<p>This question was quickly answered. They all agreed
to answer "Guilty." The only one that dissented was an
old laborer, whose answer to all questions was "Not
guilty."</p>

<p>The foreman thought that he did not understand the
questions and proceeded to explain that from all the facts
it was evident that Kartinkin and Bochkova were guilty,
but the laborer answered that he did understand them,
and that he thought that they ought to be charitable.
"We are not saints ourselves," he said, and did not change
his opinion.</p>

<p>The second question, relating to Bochkova, after many
arguments and elucidations, was answered "Not guilty,"
because there was no clear proof that she participated in
the poisoning&mdash;a fact on which her lawyer put much
stress.</p>

<p>The merchant, desiring to acquit Maslova, insisted that
Bochkova was the author of the conspiracy. Many of the
jurymen agreed with him, but the foreman, desiring to
conform strictly to the law, said that there was no foundation
for the charge of poisoning against her. After a
lengthy argument the foreman's opinion triumphed.</p>

<p>The fourth question, relating to Bochkova, was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>answered
"Guilty," but at the insistence of the laborer, she
was recommended to the mercy of the court.</p>

<p>The third question called forth fierce argument. The
foreman insisted that she was guilty of both the poisoning
and robbery; the merchant, colonel, clerk and laborer opposed
this view, while the others hesitated, but the opinion
of the foreman began to predominate, principally because
the jury were tired out, and they willingly joined the side
which promised to prevail the sooner, and consequently
release them quicker.</p>

<p>From all that occurred at the trial and his knowledge of
Maslova, Nekhludoff was convinced that she was innocent,
and at first was confident that the other jurors would
so find her, but when he saw that because of the merchant's
bungling defense of Maslova, evidently prompted
by his undisguised liking for her, and the foreman's resistance
which it caused, but chiefly because of the weariness
of the jury, there was likely to be a verdict of guilty,
he wished to make objection, but feared to speak in her
favor lest his relations toward her should be disclosed. At
the same time he felt that he could not let things go on
without making his objections. He blushed and grew
pale in turn, and was about to speak, when Peter Gerasimovich,
heretofore silent, evidently exasperated by the authoritative
manner of the foreman, suddenly began to
make the very objections Nekhludoff intended to make.</p>

<p>"Permit me to say a few words," he began. "You say
that she stole the money because she had the key; but the
servants could have opened the trunk with a false key
after she was gone."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," the merchant came to his support.</p>

<p>"She could not have taken the money because she would
have nowhere to hide it."</p>

<p>"That is what I said," the merchant encouraged him.</p>

<p>"It is more likely that her coming to the hotel for the
money suggested to the servants the idea of stealing it;
that they stole it and then threw it all upon her."</p>

<p>Peter Gerasimovich spoke provokingly, which communicated
itself to the foreman. As a result the latter
began to defend his position more persistently. But Peter
Gerasimovich spoke so convincingly that he won over the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>majority, and it was finally decided that she was not
guilty of the theft. When, however, they began to discuss
the part she had taken in the poisoning, her warm
supporter, the merchant, argued that this charge must also
be dismissed, as she had no motive for poisoning him.
The foreman insisted that she could not be declared innocent
on that charge, because she herself confessed to
giving him the powder.</p>

<p>"But she thought that it was opium," said the merchant.</p>

<p>"She could have killed him even with the opium," retorted
the colonel, who liked to make digressions, and
he began to relate the case of his brother-in-law's wife,
who had been poisoned by opium and would have died
had not antidotes promptly been administered by a physician
who happened to be in the neighborhood. The
colonel spoke so impressively and with such self-confidence
and dignity that no one dared to interrupt him.
Only the clerk, infected by the example set by the colonel,
thought of telling a story of his own.</p>

<p>"Some people get so accustomed to opium," he began,
"that they can take forty drops at a time. A relative of
mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the colonel would brook no interruption, and went
on to tell of the effect of the opium on his brother-in-law's
wife.</p>

<p>"It is five o'clock, gentlemen," said one of the jury.</p>

<p>"What do you say, gentlemen," said the foreman. "We
find her guilty, but without the intent to rob, and without
stealing any property&mdash;is that correct?"</p>

<p>Peter Gerasimovich, pleased with the victory he had
gained, agreed to the verdict.</p>

<p>"And we recommend her to the mercy of the court,"
added the merchant.</p>

<p>Every one agreed except the laborer, who insisted on a
verdict of "Not guilty."</p>

<p>"But that is the meaning of the verdict," explained the
foreman. "Without the intent to rob, and without stealing
any property&mdash;hence she is not guilty."</p>

<p>"Don't forget to throw in the recommendation to
mercy. If there be anything left that will wipe it out,"
joyfully said the merchant. They were so tired and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>arguments had so confused them that it did not occur to
any one to add "but without the intent to cause the death
of the merchant."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff was so excited that he did not notice it.
The answers were in this form taken to the court.</p>

<p>Rabelais relates the story of a jurist who was trying a
case, and who, after citing innumerable laws and reading
twenty pages of incomprehensible judicial Latin, made an
offer to the litigants to throw dice; if an even number fell
then the plaintiff was right; if an odd number the defendant
was right.</p>

<p>It was the same here. The verdict was reached not because
the majority of the jury agreed to it, but first because
the justiciary had so drawn out his speech that he
failed to properly instruct the jury; second, because the
colonel's story about his brother-in-law's wife was
tedious; third, because Nekhludoff was so excited that he
did not notice the omission of the clause limiting the intent
in the answer, and thought that the words "without
intent to rob" negatively answered the question; fourth,
because Peter Gerasimovich was not in the room when
the foreman read the questions and answers, and chiefly
because the jury were tired out and were anxious to get
away, and therefore agreed to the verdict which it was
easiest to reach.</p>

<p>They rang the bell. The gendarme sheathed his sword
and stood aside. The judges, one by one, took their seats
and the jury filed out.</p>

<p>The foreman held the list with a solemn air. He approached
the justiciary and handed it to him. The justiciary
read it, and, with evident surprise, turned to consult
with his associates. He was surprised that the jury,
in limiting the charge by the words, "without intent to
rob," should fail to add also "without intent to cause
death." It followed from the decision of the jury, that
Maslova had not stolen or robbed, but had poisoned a man
without any apparent reason.</p>

<p>"Just see what an absurd decision they have reached,"
he said to the associate on his left. "This means hard
labor for her, and she is not guilty."</p>

<p>"Why not guilty?" said the stern associate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>"She is simply not guilty. I think that chapter 818
might properly be applied to this case." (Chapter 818
gives the court the power to set aside an unjust verdict.)</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he asked the kind associate.</p>

<p>"I agree with you."</p>

<p>"And you?" he asked the choleric associate.</p>

<p>"By no means," he answered, decidedly. "As it is, the
papers say that too many criminals are discharged by
juries. What will they say, then, if the court should discharge
them? I will not agree under any circumstances."</p>

<p>The justiciary looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"It is a pity, but what can I do?" and he handed the
questions to the foreman.</p>

<p>They all rose, and the foreman, standing now on one
foot, now on the other, cleared his throat and read the
questions and answers. All the officers of the court&mdash;the
secretary, the lawyers and even the prosecutor&mdash;expressed
surprise.</p>

<p>The prisoners, who evidently did not understand the
significance of the answers, were serene. When the reading
was over, the justiciary asked the prosecutor what
punishment he thought should be imposed on the prisoners.</p>

<p>The prosecutor, elated by the successful verdict against
Maslova, which he ascribed to his eloquence, consulted
some books, then rose and said:</p>

<p>"Simon Kartinkin, I think, should be punished according
to chapter 1,452, sec. 4, and chapter 1,453; Euphemia
Bochkova according to chapter 1,659, and Katherine
Maslova according to chapter 1,454."</p>

<p>All these were the severest punishments that could be
imposed for the crimes.</p>

<p>"The court will retire to consider their decision," said
the justiciary, rising.</p>

<p>Everybody then rose, and, with a relieved and pleasant
feeling of having fulfilled an important duty, walked
around the court-room.</p>

<p>"What a shameful mess we have made of it," said Peter
Gerasimovitch, approaching Nekhludoff, to whom the
foreman was telling a story. "Why, we have sentenced
her to hard labor."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>"Is it possible?" exclaimed Nekhludoff, taking no notice
at all this time of the unpleasant familiarity of the
tutor.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," he said. "We have not inserted in
the answer, 'Guilty, but without intent to cause death.'
The secretary has just told me that the law cited by the
prosecutor provides fifteen years' hard labor."</p>

<p>"But that was our verdict," said the foreman.</p>

<p>Peter Gerasimovitch began to argue that it was self-evident
that as she did not steal the money she could not
have intended to take the merchant's life.</p>

<p>"But I read the questions before we left the room," the
foreman justified himself, "and no one objected."</p>

<p>"I was leaving the room at the time," said Peter Gerasimovitch.
"But how did you come to miss it?"</p>

<p>"I did not think of it," answered Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"You did not!"</p>

<p>"We can right it yet," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"No, we cannot&mdash;it is all over now."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff looked at the prisoners. While their fate
was being decided, they sat motionless behind the grating
in front of the soldiers. Maslova was smiling.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff's soul was stirred by evil thoughts. When
he thought that she would be freed and remain in the city,
he was undecided how he should act toward her, and it
was a difficult matter. But Siberia and penal servitude at
once destroyed the possibility of their meeting again. The
wounded bird would stop struggling in the game-bag, and
would no longer remind him of its existence.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p>The apprehensions of Peter Gerasimovitch were justified.</p>

<p>On returning from the consultation-room the justiciary
produced a document and read the following:</p>

<p>"By order of His Imperial Majesty, the Criminal Division
of the &mdash;&mdash; Circuit Court, in conformity with the finding
of the jury, and in accordance with ch. 771, s. 3, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ch. 776, s. 3, and ch. 777 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
this 28th day of April, 188&mdash;, decrees that Simon
Kartinkin, thirty-three years of age, and Katherine Maslova,
twenty-seven years of age, be deprived of all civil
rights, and sent to penal servitude, Kartinkin for eight,
Maslova for the term of four years, under conditions prescribed
by ch. 25 of the Code. Euphemia Bochkova is deprived
of all civil and special rights and privileges, and is
to be confined in jail for the period of three years under
conditions prescribed by ch. 49 of the Code, with the costs
of the trial to be borne by all three, and in case of their inability
to pay, to be paid out of the treasury.</p>

<p>"The exhibits are to be sold, the ring returned, and the
vials destroyed."</p>

<p>Kartinkin stood like a post, and with outstretched fingers
held up the sleeves of his coat, moving his jaws.
Bochkova seemed to be calm. When Maslova heard the
decision, she turned red in the face.</p>

<p>"I am innocent, I am innocent!" she suddenly cried.
"It is a sin. I am innocent. I never wished; never
thought. It is the truth." And sinking to the bench, she
began to cry aloud.</p>

<p>When Kartinkin and Bochkova left the court-room she
was still standing and crying, so that the gendarme had to
touch the sleeve of her coat.</p>

<p>"She cannot be left to her fate," said Nekhludoff to himself,
entirely forgetting his evil thoughts, and, without
knowing why, he ran into the corridor to look at her
again. He was detained at the door for a few minutes
by the jostling, animated crowd of jurors and lawyers, who
were glad that the case was over, so that when he reached
the corridor Maslova was some distance away. Without
thinking of the attention he was attracting, with quick
step he overtook her, walked a little ahead of her and
stopped. She had ceased to cry, only a sob escaped her
now and then while she wiped her tears with a corner of
her 'kerchief. She passed him without turning to look at
him. He then hastily returned to see the justiciary. The
latter had left his room, and Nekhludoff found him in the
porter's lodge.</p>

<p>"Judge," said Nekhludoff, approaching him at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>moment when he was putting on a light overcoat and taking
a silver-handled cane which the porter handed him,
"may I speak to you about the case that has just been
tried? I am a juror."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Prince Nekhludoff! I am delighted
to see you. We have met before," said the justiciary,
pressing his hand, and recalling with pleasure that he was
the jolliest fellow and best dancer of all the young men
on the evening he had met him. "What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"There was a mistake in the jury's finding against Maslova.
She is not guilty of poisoning, and yet she is sent
to penal servitude," he said, with a gloomy countenance.</p>

<p>"The court gave its decision in accordance with your
own finding," answered the justiciary, moving toward
the door, "although the answers did not seem to suit the
case."</p>

<p>He remembered that he intended to explain to the jury
that an answer of guilty without a denial of intent to kill
involved an intent to kill, but, as he was hastening to terminate
the proceedings, he failed to do so.</p>

<p>"But could not the mistake be rectified?"</p>

<p>"Cause for appeal can always be found. You must see
a lawyer," said the justiciary, putting on his hat a little
on one side and continuing to move toward the door.</p>

<p>"But this is terrible."</p>

<p>"You see, one of two things confronted Maslova," the
justiciary said, evidently desiring to be as pleasant and
polite with Nekhludoff as possible. Then, arranging his
side-whiskers over his coat collar, and taking Nekhludoff's
arm, he led him toward the door. "You are also going?"
he continued.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nekhludoff, hastily donning his overcoat
and following him.</p>

<p>They came out into the bright, cheerful sunlight, where
the rattling of wheels on the pavement made it necessary
to raise their voices.</p>

<p>"The situation, you see, is a very curious one," continued
the justiciary. "Maslova was confronted by one
of two things: either a short term in jail, in which case
her lengthy confinement would have been taken into <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>consideration,
or penal servitude; no other sentence was possible.
Had you added the words, 'without intent to kill,'
she would have been discharged."</p>

<p>"It is unpardonable neglect on my part," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"That is the whole trouble," the justiciary said, smiling
and looking at his watch.</p>

<p>There was only three-quarters of an hour left to the
latest hour fixed in Clara's appointment.</p>

<p>"You can apply to a lawyer, if you wish. It is necessary
to find grounds for appeal. But that can always be
found. To the Dvorianskaia," he said to the cab-driver.
"Thirty kopecks&mdash;I never pay more."</p>

<p>"All right, Your Excellency."</p>

<p>"Good-day. If I can be of any service to you, please
let me know. You will easily remember my address:
Dvornikoff's house, on the Dvorinskaia."</p>

<p>And, making a graceful bow, he rode off.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>


<p>The conversation with the justiciary and the pure air
somewhat calmed Nekhludoff. The feeling he experienced
he now ascribed to the fact that he had passed the
day amid surroundings to which he was unaccustomed.</p>

<p>"It is certainly a remarkable coincidence! I must do
what is necessary to alleviate her lot, and do it quickly.
Yes, I must find out here where Fanarin or Mikishin
lives." <a name="Nekhludoff" id="Nekhludoff"></a>Nekhludoff called to mind these two well-known
lawyers.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff returned to the court-house, took off his
overcoat and walked up the stairs. In the very first corridor
he met Fanarin. He stopped him and told him
that he had some business with him. Fanarin knew him
by sight, and also his name. He told Nekhludoff that he
would be glad to do anything to please him.</p>

<p>"I am rather tired, but, if it won't take long, I will
listen to your case. Let us walk into that room."</p>

<p>And Fanarin led Nekhludoff into a room, probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>the cabinet of some judge. They seated themselves at a
table.</p>

<p>"Well, state your case."</p>

<p>"First of all, I will ask you," said Nekhludoff, "not to
disclose that I am interesting myself in this case."</p>

<p>"That is understood. Well?"</p>

<p>"I was on a jury to-day, and we sent an innocent
woman to Siberia. It torments me."</p>

<p>To his own surprise, Nekhludoff blushed and hesitated.
Fanarin glanced at him, then lowered his eyes and
listened.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We condemned an innocent woman, and I would
like to have the case appealed to a higher court."</p>

<p>"To the Senate?" Fanarin corrected him.</p>

<p>"And I wish you to take the case."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff wanted to get through the most difficult
part, and therefore immediately added:</p>

<p>"I take all expenses on myself, whatever they may be,"
he said, blushing.</p>

<p>"Well, we will arrange all that," said the lawyer, condescendingly
smiling at Nekhludoff's inexperience.</p>

<p>"What are the facts of the case?"</p>

<p>Nekhludoff related them.</p>

<p>"Very well; I will examine the record to-morrow. Call
at my office the day after&mdash;no, better on Thursday, at six
o'clock in the evening, and I will give you an answer.
And now let us go; I must make some inquiries here."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff bade him good-by, and departed.</p>

<p>His conversation with the lawyer, and the fact that
he had already taken steps to defend Maslova, still more
calmed his spirit. The weather was fine, and when Nekhludoff
found himself on the street, he gladly inhaled the
spring air. Cab drivers offered their services, but he preferred
to walk, and a swarm of thoughts and recollections
of Katiousha and his conduct toward her immediately
filled his head. He became sad, and everything appeared
to him gloomy. "No, I will consider it later," he
said to himself, "and now I must have some diversion
from these painful impressions."</p>

<p>The dinner at the Korchagin's came to his mind, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>he looked at his watch. It was not too late to reach there
for dinner. A tram-car passed by. He ran after it, and
boarded it at a bound. On the square he jumped off, took
one of the best cabs, and ten minutes later he alighted
in front of Korchagin's large dwelling.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>


<p>"Walk in, Your Excellency, you are expected," said the
fat porter, pushing open the swinging, oaken door of the
entrance. "They are dining, but I was told to admit
you."</p>

<p>The porter walked to the stairway and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Are there any guests?" Nekhludoff asked, while taking
off his coat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kolosoff, also Michael Sergeievich, besides the
family," answered the porter.</p>

<p>A fine-looking lackey in dress coat and white gloves
looked down from the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Please to walk in, Your Excellency," he said.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff mounted the stairs, and through the spacious
and magnificent parlor he entered the dining-room.
Around the table were seated the entire family, except
Princess Sophia Vasilievna, who never left her own apartments.
At the head of the table sat old Korchagin, on his
left the physician; on his right, a visitor, Ivan Ivanovich
Kolosoff, an ex-district commander, and now a bank
manager, who was a friend of the family, and of liberal
tendencies; further to the left was Miss Rader, governess
to Missy's four-year-old sister, with the little girl
herself; then to the right, Missy's only brother, Peter, a
high-school pupil, on account of whose forthcoming examinations
the entire family remained in the city, and his
tutor, also a student; then again to the left, Katherine
Alexeievna, a forty-year-old girl Slavophile; opposite to
her was Michael Sergeievich, or Misha Telegin, Missy's
cousin, and at the foot of the table, Missy herself, and beside
her, on the table, lay an extra cover.</p>

<p>"Ah, very glad you came! Take a seat! We are still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>at the fish," chewing carefully with his false teeth old
Korchagin said, lifting his bloodshot eyes on Nekhludoff.
"Stepan!" he turned with a full mouth to the fat, majestic
servant, pointing with his eyes to Nekhludoff's
plate. Although Nekhludoff had often dined with and
knew Korchagin well, this evening his old face, his sensual,
smacking lips, the napkin stuck under his vest, the
fat neck, and especially the well-fed, military figure made
an unpleasant impression on him.</p>

<p>"It is all ready, Your Excellency," said Stepan, taking
a soup ladle from the sideboard and nodding to the fine-looking
servant with the side-whiskers, who immediately
began to set the table beside Missy.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff went around the table shaking hands with
every one. All, except Korchagin and the ladies, rose
from their seats when he approached them. And this
walking around the table and his handshaking, although
most of the people were comparative strangers to him,
this evening seemed to Nekhludoff particularly unpleasant
and ridiculous. He excused himself for his late coming,
and was about to seat himself at the end of the
table between Missy and Katherine Alexeievna, when
old Korchagin demanded that, since he would not take
any brandy, he should first take a bite at the table, on
which were lobster, caviare, cheese and herring. Nekhludoff
did not know he was as hungry as he turned out to
be, and when he tasted of some cheese and bread he could
not stop eating, and ate ravenously.</p>

<p>"Well? Have you been undermining the bases of society?"
asked Kolosoff, ironically, using an expression of
a retrogressive newspaper, which was attacking the jury
system. "You have acquitted the guilty and condemned
the innocent? Have you?"</p>

<p>"Undermining the bases&mdash;undermining the bases"&mdash;smilingly
repeated the Prince, who had boundless confidence
in the intelligence and honesty of his liberal comrade
and friend.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff, at the risk of being impolite, did not answer
Kolosoff, and, seating himself before the steaming
soup, continued to eat.</p>

<p>"Do let him eat," said Missy, smiling. By the pronoun
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>"him," she meant to call attention to her intimacy with
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kolosoff was energetically and loudly discussing
the article against trial by jury which had roused
his indignation. Michael Sergeievich supported his contentions
and quoted the contents of another similar article.</p>

<p>Missy, as usual, was very <i>distingue</i> and unobtrusively
well dressed. She waited until Nekhludoff had swallowed
the mouthful he was chewing, and then said: "You must
be very tired and hungry."</p>

<p>"Not particularly. Are you? Have you been to the exhibition?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, we postponed it. But we went to play lawn tennis
at the Salamatoff's. Mister Crooks is really a remarkable
player."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff had came here for recreation, and it was
always pleasant to him to be in this house, not only because
of the elegant luxury, which acted pleasantly on his
senses, but because of the adulating kindnesses with
which they invisibly surrounded him. To-day, however&mdash;it
is wonderful to relate&mdash;everything in this house
disgusted him; the porter, the broad stairway, the flowers,
the lackeys, the table decorations, and even Missy
herself, who, just now, seemed to him unattractive and
unnatural. He was disgusted with that self-confident,
vulgar, liberal tone of Kolosoff, the bull-like, sensual,
figure of old Korchagin, the French phrases of the Slavophile
maiden, the ceremonious faces of the governess and
the tutor. But above all, he was disgusted with the pronoun
"him" that Missy had used. Nekhludoff was always
wavering between two different relations he sustained
toward Missy. Sometimes he looked at her as
through blinking eyes or by moonlight, and then she
seemed to him beautiful, fresh, pretty, clever and natural.
At other times he looked at her as if under a bright sun,
and then he saw only her defects. To-day was such a
day. He saw the wrinkles on her face; saw the artificial
arrangement of her hair; the pointed elbows, and, above
all, her large thumb nail, resembling that of her father.</p>

<p>"It is the dullest game," Kolosoff said, speaking of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>tennis, "baseball, as we played it when we were boys, is
much more amusing."</p>

<p>"You have not tried it. It is awfully interesting," retorted
Missy, unnaturally accentuating the word "awfully,"
as it seemed to Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>A discussion arose in which Michael Sergeievich and
Katherine Alexeievna took part. Only the governess, the
tutor and the children were silent, evidently from ennui.</p>

<p>"They are eternally disputing!" laughing aloud, said
old Korchagin. He pulled the napkin from his vest, and,
noisily pushing back his chair, which was immediately removed
by a servant, rose from the table. They all
rose after him and went to a small table, on which stood
figured bowls filled with perfumed water; then they washed
their finger-tips and rinsed their mouths, and continued
their conversation, in which no one took any interest.</p>

<p>"Is it not true?" Missy said to Nekhludoff, desiring to
receive confirmation of her opinion that man's character
can best be learned in play. She noticed on his thoughtful
face an expression of reproach, which inspired her
with fear, and she wished to know the cause of it.</p>

<p>"I really don't know. I never thought of it," answered
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Will you go to mamma?" asked Missy.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, producing a cigarette. The tone of
his voice plainly betrayed that he did not wish to go.</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly, but was silent. He felt
ashamed. "It is hardly proper for me to come here to put
people out of temper," he thought, and, in an effort to be
pleasant, he said that he would go with pleasure if the
Princess were in a mood to receive him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; mamma will be glad. You can smoke there
also. And Ivan Ivanovich is with her."</p>

<p>The mistress of the house, Sophia Vasilievna, was an
invalid. For eight years she had reclined in laces and ribbons,
amid velvet, gilding, ivory, bronzes and flowers.
She never drove out, and received only her "friends," i.&nbsp;e.,
whoever, according to her view, in any way distinguished
himself from the crowd. Nekhludoff was one of these
friends, not only because he was considered a clever
young man, but also because his mother was a close
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>friend of the family and he was a desirable match for
Missy.</p>

<p>Her room was beyond the small and large drawing-rooms.
In the large drawing-room Missy, who preceded
Nekhludoff, suddenly stopped, and placing her hands on
the back of a gilt chair, looked at him.</p>

<p>Missy was very anxious to be married, and Nekhludoff
was a desirable party. Besides, she liked him, and had
become accustomed to the thought that he would belong
to her, and not she to him, and, with the unconscious but
persistent craftiness of heart-sick persons, she gained her
end. She addressed him now with the intention of bringing
forth an explanation.</p>

<p>"I see that something has happened to you," she said.
"What is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>The meeting in the court came to his mind, and he
frowned and blushed.</p>

<p>"Yes, something has happened," he said, desiring to be
truthful. "It was a strange, extraordinary and important
event."</p>

<p>"What was it? Can't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Not now. Don't press me for an answer. I have
not had the time to think over the matter," he said, blushing
still more.</p>

<p>"And you will not tell me?" The muscles on her
cheek quivered, and she pushed away the chair.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot," he answered, feeling that answering
her thus he answered himself&mdash;admitted to himself that
something very important had really happened to him.</p>

<p>"Well, then, come!"</p>

<p>She shook her head as if desiring to drive away undesirable
thoughts, and walked forward with a quicker step
than usual.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that she unnaturally compressed her
lips in order to suppress her tears. It was painful to him
to grieve her, but he knew that the slightest weakness
would ruin him, i.&nbsp;e., bind him. And this he feared more
than anything else to-day, so he silently followed her to
the door of the Princess' apartments.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>


<p>Princess Sophia Vasilievna had finished her meal of
choice and nourishing dishes, which she always took
alone, that no one might see her performing that unpoetical
function. A cup of coffee stood on a small table
near her couch, and she was smoking a cigarette. Princess
Sophia Vasilievna was a lean and tall brunette, with
long teeth and large black eyes, who desired to pass for
a young woman.</p>

<p>People were making unpleasant remarks about her relations
with the doctor. Formerly Nekhludoff had paid
no attention to them. But to-day, the sight of the doctor,
with his oily, sleek head, which was parted in the middle,
sitting near her couch, was repulsive to him.</p>

<p>Beside the Princess sat Kolosoff, stirring the coffee. A
glass of liquor was on the table.</p>

<p>Missy entered, together with Nekhludoff, but she did
not remain in the room.</p>

<p>"When mamma gets tired of you and drives you away,
come to my room," she said, turning to Nekhludoff, as if
nothing had happened, and, smiling cheerfully, she walked
out of the room, her steps deadened by the heavy carpet.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you do, my friend? Sit down and tell
us the news," said Sophia Vasilievna, with an artful,
feigned, resembling a perfectly natural, smile, which displayed
her beautiful, long, skillfully made, almost natural-looking
teeth. "I am told that you returned from the
court in very gloomy spirits. It must be very painful to
people with a heart," she said in French.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," said Nekhludoff. "One often feels
his&mdash;feels that he has no right to judge others."</p>

<p>"Comme c'est vrai!" she exclaimed, as if struck by the
truth of the remark, and, as usual, artfully flattering her
friend.</p>

<p>"And what about your picture? It interests me very
much," she added. "Were it not for my indisposition, I
should have visited you long ago."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>"I have given up painting entirely," he answered dryly.
Her unjust flattery was as apparent to him to-day as was
her age, which she attempted to conceal. Try as he
would, he could not force himself to be pleasant.</p>

<p>"It is too bad! You know, Riepin himself told me that
Nekhludoff possesses undoubted talent," she said, turning
to Kolosoff.</p>

<p>"What a shameless liar!" Nekhludoff thought, frowning.</p>

<p>Seeing that Nekhludoff was in ill humor, and could
not be drawn into pleasant and clear conversation,
Sophia Vasilievna turned to Kolosoff for his opinion of
the new drama, with an air as if Kolosoff's opinion would
dispel all doubt and every word of his was destined to
become immortalized. Kolosoff condemned the drama
and took occasion to state his views on art. The correctness
of his views seemed to impress her; she attempted to
defend the author of the drama, but immediately yielded,
or found a middle ground. Nekhludoff looked and listened
and yet saw and heard but little.</p>

<p>Listening now to Sophia Vasilievna, now to Kolosoff,
Nekhludoff saw, first, that neither of them cared either for
the drama or for each other, and that they were talking
merely to satisfy a physiological craving to exercise, after
dinner, the muscles of the tongue and throat. Secondly,
he saw that Kolosoff, who had drunk brandy, wine and
liquors, was somewhat tipsy&mdash;not as drunk as a drinking
peasant, but like a man to whom wine-drinking has become
a habit. He did not reel, nor did he talk nonsense,
but was in an abnormal, excited and contented condition.
Thirdly, Nekhludoff saw that Princess Sophia Vasilievna,
during the conversation, now and again anxiously glanced
at the window, through which a slanting ray of the sun
was creeping toward her, threatening to throw too much
light on her aged face.</p>

<p>"How true it is," she said of some remark of Kolosoff,
and pressed a button on the wall near the couch.</p>

<p>At this moment the doctor rose with as little ceremony
as one of the family, and walked out of the room. Sophia
Vasilievna followed him with her eyes.</p>

<p>"Please, Phillip, let down that curtain," she said to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>fine-looking servant who responded to the bell, her eyes
pointing to the window.</p>

<p>"Say what you will, but there is something mystical
about him, and without mysticism there is no poetry," she
said, with one black eye angrily following the movements
of the servant who was lowering the curtain.</p>

<p>"Mysticism without poetry is superstition, and poetry
without mysticism is prose," she continued, smiling sadly,
still keeping her eye on the servant, who was smoothing
down the curtain.</p>

<p>"Not that curtain, Phillip&mdash;the one at the large window,"
she said in a sad voice, evidently pitying herself for
the efforts she was compelled to make to say these words,
and to calm herself, with her ring-bedecked hand, she lifted
to her lips the fragrant, smoking cigarette.</p>

<p>The broad-chested, muscular Phillip bowed slightly, as
if excusing himself, and submissively and silently stepped
over to the next window, and, carefully looking at the
Princess, so arranged the curtain that no stray ray should
fall on her. It was again unsatisfactory, and again the
exhausted Princess was obliged to interrupt her conversation
about mysticism and correct the unintelligent Phillip,
who was pitilessly tormenting her. For a moment
Phillip's eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>"'The devil knows what you want,' he is probably saying
to himself," Nekhludoff thought, as he watched this
play. But the handsome, strong Phillip concealed his impatience,
and calmly carried out the instructions of the
enervated, weak, artificial Princess Sophia Vasilievna.</p>

<p>"Of course there is considerable truth in Darwin's
theory," said the returning Kolosoff, stretching himself on
a low arm-chair and looking through sleepy eyes at the
Princess, "but he goes too far."</p>

<p>"And do you believe in heredity?" she asked Nekhludoff,
oppressed by his silence.</p>

<p>"In heredity?" repeated Nekhludoff. "No, I do not,"
he said, being entirely absorbed at the moment by those
strange forms which, for some reason, appeared to his
imagination. Alongside of the strong, handsome Phillip,
whom he looked upon as a model, he imagined Kolosoff,
naked, his abdomen like a water-melon, bald-headed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>his arms hanging like two cords. He also dimly imagined
what the silk-covered shoulders of Sophia Vasilievna
would appear like in reality, but the picture was too terrible,
and he drove it from his mind.</p>

<p>Sophia Vasilievna scanned him from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Missy is waiting for you," she said. "Go to her room;
she wished to play for you a new composition by Schuman.
It is very interesting."</p>

<p>"It isn't true. Why should she lie so!" Nekhludoff
thought, rising and pressing her transparent, bony, ring-bedecked
hand.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room he met Katherine Alexeievna, returning
to her mother's apartments. As usual, she
greeted him in French.</p>

<p>"I see that the duties of juryman act depressingly upon
you," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, pardon me. I am in low spirits to-day, and I
have no right to bore people," answered Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Why are you in low spirits?"</p>

<p>"Permit me not to speak of it," he said, looking for his
hat as they entered the Princess' cabinet.</p>

<p>"And do you remember telling us that one ought to tell
the truth? And what cruel truths you used to tell us!
Why don't you tell us now? Do you remember, Missy?"
the Princess turned to Missy, who had just entered.</p>

<p>"Because that was in play," answered Nekhludoff
gravely. "In play it is permissible, but in reality we are
so bad, that is, I am so bad, that I, at least, cannot tell the
truth."</p>

<p>"Don't correct yourself, but rather say that we are so
bad," said Katherine Alexeievna, playing with the words,
and pretending not to see Nekhludoff's gravity.</p>

<p>"There is nothing worse than to confess being in low
spirits," said Missy. "I never confess it to myself, and
that is why I am always cheerful. Well, come to my
room. We shall try to drive away your mauvais humeur."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff experienced the feeling which a horse must
feel when brushed down before the bridle is put on and it
is led to be harnessed to the wagon. But to-day he was
not at all disposed to draw. He excused himself and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>began to take leave. Missy kept his hand longer than
usual.</p>

<p>"Remember that what is important to you is important
to your friends," she said. "Will you come to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I will," said Nekhludoff. And feeling
ashamed, without knowing himself whether for her or for
himself, he blushed and hastily departed.</p>

<p>"What does it mean? Comme cela m'intrigue," said
Katherine Alexeievna, when Nekhludoff had left. "I
must find it out. Some affaire d'amour propre; il est tr&egrave;s
susceptible notre cher Mitia."</p>

<p>"Plut&ocirc;t une affaire d'amour sale," Missy was going to
say. Her face was now wan and pale. But she did not
give expression to that passage, and only said: "We all
have our bright days and gloomy days."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that he, too, should deceive me?" she
thought. "After all that has happened, it would be very
wrong of him."</p>

<p>If Missy had had to explain what she meant by the
words, "After all that has happened," she could have told
nothing definite, and yet she undoubtedly knew that not
only had he given her cause to hope, but he had almost
made his promise&mdash;not in so many words, but by his
glances, his smiles, his innuendos, his silence. She considered
him her own, and to lose him would be very painful
to her.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>


<p>"It is shameful and disgusting," Nekhludoff meditated,
while returning home on foot along the familiar streets.
The oppressive feeling which he had experienced while
speaking to Missy clung to him. He understood that
nominally, if one may so express himself, he was in the
right; he had never said anything to bind himself to her;
had made no offer, but in reality he felt that he had bound
himself to her, that he had promised to be hers. Yet he
felt in all his being that he could not marry her.</p>

<p>"It is shameful and disgusting," he repeated, not only
of his relations to Missy, but of everything. "Everything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>is disgusting and shameful," he repeated to himself, as he
ascended the steps of his house.</p>

<p>"I shall take no supper," he said to Kornei, who followed
him into the dining-room, where the table was set
for his supper. "You may go."</p>

<p>"All right," said Kornei, but did not go, and began to
clear the table. Nekhludoff looked at Kornei and an ill
feeling sprung up in his heart toward him. He wished
to be left in peace, and it seemed as if everybody were
spitefully worrying him. When Kornei had left, Nekhludoff
went over to the <i>samovar</i>, intending to make some
tea, but, hearing the footsteps of Agrippina Petrovna, he
hastily walked into the drawing-room, closing the door behind
him. This was the room in which, three months ago,
his mother had died. Now, as he entered this room,
lighted by two lamps with reflectors&mdash;one near a portrait
of his father, the other near a portrait of his mother&mdash;he
thought of his relations toward his mother, and these relations
seemed to him unnatural and repulsive. These, too,
were shameful and disgusting. He remembered how,
during her last sickness, he wished her to die. He said
to himself that he wished it so that she might be spared
the suffering, but in reality he wished to spare himself
the sight of her suffering.</p>

<p>Desiring to call forth pleasant recollections about her,
he looked at her portrait, painted by a famous artist for
five thousand rubles. She was represented in a black
velvet dress with bared breast. The artist had evidently
drawn with particular care the breast and the beautiful
shoulders and neck. That was particularly shameful and
disgusting. There was something revolting and sacriligious
to him in this representation of his mother as a
denuded beauty, the more so because three months ago
she lay in this very room shrunken like a mummy, and
filling the entire house with an oppressive odor. He
thought he could smell the odor now. He remembered
how, on the day before she died, she took his strong, white
hand into her own emaciated, discolored one, and, looking
into his eyes, said: "Do not judge me, Mitia, if I have not
done as I should," and her faded eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"How disgusting!" he again repeated to himself, glancing
at the half-nude woman with splendid marble shoulders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>and arms and a triumphant smile on her lips. The
bared bosom of that portrait reminded him of another
young woman whom he had seen dressed in a similar way
a few days before. It was Missy, who had invited him to
the house under some pretext, in order to display before
him her ball-dress. He recalled with disgust her beautiful
shoulders and arms; and her coarse, brutal father, with
his dark past, his cruelties, and her mother with her doubtful
reputation. All this was disgusting and at the same
time shameful.</p>

<p>"No, no; I must free myself from all these false relations
with the Korchagins, with Maria Vasilievna, with
the inheritance and all the rest," he thought. "Yes, to
breathe freely; to go abroad&mdash;to Rome&mdash;and continue to
work on my picture." He remembered his doubts about
his talent. "Well, it is all the same; I will simply breathe
freely. First, I will go to Constantinople, then to Rome&mdash;away
from this jury duty. Yes, and to fix matters with
the lawyer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And suddenly, before his imagination, appeared with uncommon
vividness the picture of the prisoner with the
black, squinting eyes. And how she wept when the last
words of the prisoners were spoken! He hastily crushed
the cigarette he was smoking, lit another, and began pacing
up and down the room. One after another the scenes
he had lived through with her rose up in his mind. He
recalled their last meeting, the passion which seized him
at the time, and the disappointment that followed. He
recalled the white dress with the blue ribbon; he recalled
the morning mass. "Why, I loved her with a pure love
that night; I loved her even before, and how I loved her
when I first came to my aunts and was writing my composition!"
That freshness, youth, fullness of life swept over
him and he became painfully sad.</p>

<p>The difference between him as he was then and as he
was now was great; it was equally great, if not greater,
than the difference between Katiousha in the church and
that girl whom they had tried this morning. Then he was
a courageous, free man, before whom opened endless possibilities;
now he felt himself caught in the tenets of a
stupid, idle, aimless, miserable life, from which there was
no escape; aye, from which, for the most part, he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>not escape. He remembered how he once had prided
himself upon his rectitude; how he always made it a rule
to tell the truth, and was in reality truthful, and how he
was now steeped in falsehood&mdash;falsehood which was recognized
as truth by all those around him.</p>

<p>And there was no escape from this falsehood; at all
events, he did not see any escape. He had sunk in it,
became accustomed to it, and indulged himself in it.</p>

<p>The questions that absorbed him now were: How to
break loose from Maria Vasilievna and her husband, so
that he might be able to look them in the face? How,
without falsehood, to disentangle his relations with Missy?
How to get out of the inconsistency of considering the
private holding of land unjust and keeping his inheritance?
How to blot out his sin against Katiousha? "I
cannot abandon the woman whom I have loved and content
myself with paying money to the lawyer to save her
from penal servitude, which she does not even deserve."
To blot out the sin, as he did then, when he thought that
he was atoning for his wrong by giving her money! Impossible!</p>

<p>He vividly recalled the moment when he ran after her
in the corridor, thrust money in her bosom, and ran away
from her. "Oh, that money!" With the same horror
and disgust he recalled that moment. "Oh, how disgusting!"
he said aloud, as he did then. "Only a scoundrel
and rascal could do it! And I am that scoundrel, that
rascal!" he said aloud. "It is possible that I&mdash;" and he
stopped in the middle of the room&mdash;"Is it possible that I
am really a scoundrel? Who but I?" he answered himself.
"And is this the only thing?" he continued, still
censuring himself. "Are not my relations toward Maria
Vasilievna base and detestable? And my position with
regard to property? Under the plea that I inherited it
from my mother I am using wealth, the ownership of
which I consider unlawful. And the whole of this idle,
abominable life? And to crown all, my conduct toward
Katiousha? Scoundrel! Villain! Let people judge me
as they please&mdash;I can deceive them, but I cannot deceive
myself."</p>

<p>And he suddenly understood that the disgust which he
had lately felt toward everybody, and especially to-day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>toward the Prince and Maria Vasilievna, and Missy, and
Kornei, was disgust with himself. And in this confession
of his own baseness there was something painful, and
at the same time joyous and calming.</p>

<p>In the course of his life Nekhludoff often experienced
what he called a "cleansing of the soul." This happened
when, after a long period of retardation, or, perhaps, entire
cessation of his inner life, he suddenly became aware
of it, and proceeded to cleanse his soul of all the accumulated
filth that caused this standstill.</p>

<p>After such awakenings Nekhludoff always laid down
some rules for himself which he intended to follow all
the rest of his life; kept a diary and began a new life, which
he hoped he should never change again&mdash;"turning a new
leaf," he used to call it. But the temptations of life entrapped
him anew, after every awakening, and, without
knowing it, he sank again, often to a lower depth than he
was in before.</p>

<p>Thus he cleansed himself and revived several times.
His first cleansing happened when he visited his aunts.
That was the brightest and most enthusiastic awakening.
And it lasted a long time. The next happened when he
left the civil service, and, desiring to sacrifice his life, he
entered, during the war, the military service. Here he
began to sink quickly. The next awakening occurred
when he retired from the military service, and, going
abroad, gave himself up to painting.</p>

<p>From that day to this there was a long period of uncleanliness,
the longest he had gone through yet, and,
therefore, he had never sunk so deep, and never before
was there such discord between the demands of his conscience
and the life which he was leading. So, when he
saw the chasm which separated the two, he was horrified.</p>

<p>The discord was so great, the defilement so thorough,
that at first he despaired of the possibility of a complete
cleansing. "Why, you have tried to improve before, and
failed," the tempter in his soul whispered. "What is the
good of trying again? You are not the only one&mdash;all are
alike. Such is life." But the free, spiritual being which
alone is true, alone powerful, alone eternal, was already
awake in Nekhludoff. And he could not help believing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>it. However great the difference between that which he
was and that which he wished to be, for the awakened
spiritual being everything was possible.</p>

<p>"I shall break this lie that binds me at any cost. I will
confess the truth to everybody, and will act the truth," he
said aloud, resolutely. "I will tell Missy the truth&mdash;that I
am a profligate and cannot marry her; that I have trifled
with her. I will tell Maria Vasilevna (the wife of the
marshal of nobility)&mdash;but no, what is the good of telling
her? I will tell her husband that I am a scoundrel, that I
have deceived him. I will dispose of my inheritance in
accordance with the demands of justice. I will tell her,
Katiousha, that I am a knave, that I have wronged her,
and will do everything in my power to alleviate her condition.
Yes, I shall see her, and beg her forgiveness&mdash;I
will beg like a child."</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>"I will marry her, if necessary."</p>

<p>He crossed his hands on his breast, as he used to do
when a child, raised his eyes and said:</p>

<p>"Lord, help me, teach me; come and enter within me
and purify me of all this abomination."</p>

<p>He prayed, asked God to help him and purify him, while
that which he was praying for had already happened.
Not only did he feel the freedom, vigor and gladness of
life, but he also felt the power of good. He felt himself
capable of doing the best that man can do.</p>

<p>There were tears in his eyes when he said these things&mdash;tears
of joy&mdash;on the awakening within him of that
spiritual being, and tears of emotion over his own virtue.</p>

<p>He felt warm and opened a window which looked into
a garden. It was a moonlit, fresh and quiet night. Past
the street rattled some vehicle, and then everything was
quiet. Directly beneath the window a tall, denuded poplar
threw its shadow on the gravel of the landing-place,
distinctly showing all the ramifications of its bare
branches. To the left the roof of a shed seemed white
under the bright light of the moon; in front were the tangled
branches of the trees, through which was seen the
dark shadow of the garden inclosure.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff looked at the moonlit garden and roof, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>shadows of the poplar, and drank in the fresh, invigorating
air.</p>

<p>"How delightful! My God, how delightful!" he said
of that which was in his soul.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>


<p>It was six o'clock when Maslova returned to her cell,
weary and foot-sore from the long tramp over the stone
pavement. Besides, she was crushed by the unexpectedly
severe sentence, and was also hungry.</p>

<p>When, during a recess, her guards had lunched on
bread and hard-boiled eggs her mouth watered and she
felt that she was hungry, but considered it humiliating to
ask them for some food. Three hours after that her hunger
had passed, and she only felt weak. In this condition she
heard the sentence. At first she thought that she misunderstood
it; she could not believe what she heard, and
could not reconcile herself to the idea that she was a convict.
But, seeing the calm, serious faces of the judges
and the jury, who received the verdict as something quite
natural, she revolted and cried out that she was innocent.
And when she saw also that her outcry, too, was taken as
something natural and anticipated, and which could not
alter the case, she began to weep. She felt that she must
submit to the cruel injustice which was perpetrated on
her. What surprised her most was that she should be
so cruelly condemned by men&mdash;not old men, but those
same young men who looked at her so kindly.</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney was the only man whose
glances were other than kind. While she was sitting in
the prisoners' room, and during recesses she saw these men
passing by her and entering the room under various pretexts,
but with the obvious intention of looking at her.
And now these same men, for some reason, sentenced her
to hard labor, although she was innocent of the crime.
For some time she wept, then became calm, and in a condition
of complete exhaustion she waited to be taken away.
She desired but one thing now&mdash;a cigarette. She was in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>this frame of mind when Bochkova and Kartinkin were
brought into the room. Bochkova immediately began to
curse her.</p>

<p>"You are innocent, aren't you? Why weren't you discharged,
you vile thing? You got your deserts! You
will drop your fineries in Siberia!"</p>

<p>Maslova sat with lowered head, her hands folded in the
sleeves of her coat, and gazed on the smoothly trampled
ground.</p>

<p>"I am not interfering with you, so leave me in peace,"
she repeated several times, then became silent. She became
enlivened again when, after Bochkova and Kartinkin
had been removed from the room, the guard entered,
bringing her three rubles.</p>

<p>"Are you Maslova?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Here is some money which a lady sent you," he said.</p>

<p>"What lady?"</p>

<p>"Take it, and ask no questions."</p>

<p>The money was sent by Kitaeva. When leaving the
court she asked the usher if she could send some money to
Maslova, and, receiving an affirmative answer, she removed
a chamois glove, and, from the back folds of her
silk dress, produced a stylish pocket-book, and counted
out the money into the hands of the usher who, in her
presence, handed it to the guard.</p>

<p>"Please be sure to give it to her," said Karolina Albertoona
to the guard.</p>

<p>The guard was offended by this distrust shown to him,
which was the cause of his speaking angrily to Maslova.</p>

<p>Maslova was overjoyed by the receipt of the money,
for it could give her the one thing she wished for now.</p>

<p>All her thoughts were now centered on her desire to
inhale the smoke of a cigarette. So strong was this desire
that she greedily inhaled the smoke-laden air which
was wafted in from the corridor and through the cabinet
door. But there was a long wait before her, for the secretary,
who was to deliver to the guard the order for her
removal, forgetting the prisoners, engaged one of the lawyers
in the discussion of an editorial that had appeared in
a newspaper.</p>

<p>At five o'clock she was finally led down through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>rear door. While in the waiting-room she gave one of
the guards twenty kopecks, asking him to buy for her two
lunch rolls and some cigarettes. The guard laughed,
took the money, honestly made the purchase and returned
the change to her. She could not smoke on the road, so
Maslova arrived at the jail with the same unsatisfied craving
for a cigarette. At that moment about a hundred
prisoners were brought from the railroad station. Maslova
met them in the passageway.</p>

<p>The prisoners, bearded, clean-shaven, old, young, Russians
and foreigners&mdash;some with half-shaved heads, and
with a clinking of iron fetters, filled the passage with
dust, tramping of feet, conversation and a sharp odor of
perspiration. The prisoners, as they passed Maslova,
scanned her from head to foot; some approached and
teased her.</p>

<p>"Fine girl, that!" said one. "My compliments, auntie,"
said another, winking one eye. A dark man with a
shaven, blue neck and long mustache, tangling in his fetters,
sprang toward her and embraced her.</p>

<p>"Don't you recognize your friend? Come, don't put
on such style!" he exclaimed, grinning as she pushed him
away.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, you rascal?" shouted the officer
in charge of the prisoners.</p>

<p>The prisoner hastily hid himself in the crowd. The officer
fell upon Maslova.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Maslova was going to say that she had been brought
from the court, but she was very tired and too lazy to
speak.</p>

<p>"She is just from the court, sir," said one of the guards,
elbowing his way through the passing crowd, and raising
his hand to his cap.</p>

<p>"Then take her to the warden. What indecencies!"</p>

<p>"Very well, sir!"</p>

<p>"Sokoloff! Take her away!" shouted the officer.</p>

<p>Sokoloff came and angrily pushed Maslova by the
shoulder, and, motioning to her to follow him, he led her
into the woman's corridor. There she was thoroughly
searched, and as nothing was found upon her (the box of
cigarettes was hidden in the lunch roll), she was admitted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>into the same cell from which she had emerged in the
morning.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>


<p>The cell in which Maslova was confined was an oblong
room, twenty feet by fifteen. The kalsomining of the
walls was peeled off, and the dry boards of the cots occupied
two-thirds of the space. In the middle of the
room, opposite the door, was a dark iron, with a wax candle
stuck on it, and a dusty bouquet of immortelles hanging
under it. To the left, behind the door, on a darkened
spot of the floor, stood an ill-smelling vat. The
women had been locked up for the night.</p>

<p>There were fifteen inmates of this cell, twelve women
and three children.</p>

<p>It was not dark yet, and only two women lay in their
cots; one a foolish little woman&mdash;she was constantly crying&mdash;who
had been arrested because she had no written
evidence of her identity, had her head covered with her
coat; the other, a consumptive, was serving a sentence for
theft. She was not sleeping, but lay, her coat under her
head, with wide-open eyes, and with difficulty retaining
in her throat the tickling, gurgling phlegm, so as not to
cough. The other women were with bare heads and
skirts of coarse linen; some sat on their cots sewing;
others stood at the window gazing on the passing prisoners.
Of the three women who were sewing, one, Korableva,
was the one who had given Maslova the instructions
when the latter left the cell. She was a tall, strong
woman, with a frowning, gloomy face, all wrinkled, a bag
of skin hanging under her chin, a short braid of light hair,
turning gray at the temples, and a hairy wart on her
cheek. This old woman was sentenced to penal servitude
for killing her husband with an axe. The killing was
committed because he annoyed her daughter with improper
advances. She was the overseer of the cell, and
also sold wine to the inmates. She was sewing with eye-glasses,
and held the needle, after the fashion of the peasants,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>with three fingers, the sharp point turned toward
her breast. Beside her, also sewing, sat a little woman,
good-natured and talkative, dark, snub-nosed and with
little black eyes. She was the watch-woman at a flag-station,
and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment
for negligently causing an accident on the railroad. The
third of the women who were occupied with sewing was
Theodosia&mdash;called Fenichka by her fellow-prisoners&mdash;of
light complexion, and with rosy cheeks; young, lovely,
with bright, childish blue eyes, and two long, flaxen braids
rolled up on her small head. She was imprisoned for attempting
to poison her husband. She was sixteen years
old when she was married, and she made the attempt immediately
after her marriage. During the eight months
that she was out on bail, she not only became reconciled
to her husband, but became so fond of him that the court
officers found them living in perfect harmony. In spite
of all the efforts of her husband, her father-in-law, and especially
her mother-in-law, who had grown very fond of
her, to obtain her discharge, she was sentenced to hard
labor in Siberia. The kind, cheerful and smiling Theodosia,
whose cot was next to Maslova's, not only took a
liking to her, but considered it her duty to help her in
every possible way. Two other women were sitting idly
on their cots; one of about forty years, who seemed to
have been pretty in her youth, but was now pale and slim,
was feeding a child with her long, white breast. Her
crime consisted in that, when the people of the village she
belonged to attempted to stop a recruiting officer who
had drafted, illegally, as they thought, her nephew, she
was the first to take hold of the bridle of his horse.
There was another little white-haired, wrinkled woman,
good-natured and hunch-backed, who sat near the oven
and pretended to be catching a four-year-old, short-haired
and stout boy, who, in a short little shirt, was running
past her, laughing and repeating: "You tan't tatch me!"
This old woman, who, with her son, was charged with
incendiarism, bore her confinement good-naturedly, grieving
only over her son, who was also in jail, but above all,
her heart was breaking for her old man who, she feared,
would be eaten up by lice, as her daughter-in-law had returned
to her parents, and there was no one to wash him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>Besides these seven women, there were four others who
stood near the open windows, their hands resting on the
iron gratings, and conversing by signs and shouts with
the prisoners whom Maslova had met in the passageway.
One of these, who was serving a sentence for theft, was a
flabby, large, heavy, red-haired woman with white-yellow
freckles over her face, and a stout neck which was exposed
by the open waist collar. In a hoarse voice she shouted
indecent words through the window. Beside her stood
a woman of the size of a ten-year-old girl, very dark,
with a long back and very short legs. Her face was red
and blotched; her black eyes wide open, and her short,
thick lips failed to hide her white, protruding teeth. She
laughed in shrill tones at the antics of the prisoners.
This prisoner, who was nicknamed Miss Dandy, because
of her stylishness, was under indictment for theft and incendiarism.
Behind them, in a very dirty, gray shirt,
stood a wretched-looking woman, big with child, who
was charged with concealing stolen property. This
woman was silent, but she approvingly smiled at the actions
of the prisoners without. The fourth of the women
who stood at the window, and was undergoing sentence for
illicit trading in spirits, was a squat little country woman
with bulging eyes and kindly face. She was the mother
of the boy who was playing with the old woman, and of
another seven-year-old girl, both of whom were in jail
with her, because they had no one else to take care of
them. Knitting a stocking, she was looking through the
window and disapprovingly frowned and closed her eyes
at the language used by the passing prisoners. The girl
who stood near the red-haired woman, with only a shirt
on her back, and clinging with one hand to the woman's
skirt, attentively listened to the abusive words the men
were exchanging with the women, and repeated them in a
whisper, as if committing them to memory. The twelfth
was the daughter of a church clerk and chanter who had
drowned her child in a well. She was a tall and stately
girl, with large eyes and tangled hair sticking out of her
short, thick, flaxen braid. She paid no attention to what
was going on around her, but paced, bare-footed, and in
a dirty gray shirt, over the floor of the cell, making
sharp and quick turns when she reached the wall.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>


<p>When with a rattling of chains the cell door was unlocked
and Maslova admitted, all eyes were turned toward
her. Even the chanter's daughter stopped for a moment
and looked at her with raised eyebrows, but immediately
resumed walking with long, resolute strides. Korableva
stuck her needle into the sack she was sewing and gazed
inquiringly through her glasses at Maslova.</p>

<p>"Ah me! So she has returned," she said in a hoarse
basso voice. "And I was sure she would be set right.
She must have got it."</p>

<p>She removed her glasses and placed them with her sewing
beside her.</p>

<p>"I have been talking with auntie, dear, and we thought
that they might discharge you at once. They say it happens.
And they sometimes give you money, if you strike
the right time," the watch-woman started in a singing
voice. "What ill-luck! It seems we were wrong. God
has His own way, dear," she went on in her caressing and
melodious voice.</p>

<p>"It is possible that they convicted you?" asked Theodosia,
with gentle compassion, looking at Maslova with
her childish, light-blue eyes, and her cheerful, young face
changed, and she seemed to be ready to cry.</p>

<p>Maslova made no answer, but silently went to her place,
next to Korableva's, and sat down.</p>

<p>"You have probably not eaten anything," said Theodosia,
rising and going over to Maslova.</p>

<p>Again Maslova did not answer, but placed the two
lunch-rolls at the head of the cot and began to undress.
She took off the dusty coat, and the 'kerchief from her
curling black hair and sat down.</p>

<p>The hunch-backed old woman also came and stopped in
front of Maslova, compassionately shaking her head.</p>

<p>The boy came behind the old woman, and, with a protruding
corner of the upper lip and wide-open eyes, gazed
on the rolls brought by Maslova. Seeing all these compassionate
faces, after what had happened, Maslova al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>most
cried and her lips began to twitch. She tried to and
did restrain herself until the old woman and the child approached.
When, however, she heard the kind, compassionate
exclamation of pity from the old woman, and,
especially, when her eyes met the serious eyes of the boy
who looked now at her, now at the rolls, she could restrain
herself no longer. Her whole face began to twitch and
she burst into sobs.</p>

<p>"I told her to take a good lawyer," said Korableva.
"Well? To Siberia?" she asked.</p>

<p>Maslova wished to answer but could not, and, crying,
she produced from the roll the box of cigarettes, on which
a picture of a red lady with a high chignon and triangle-shaped,
low cut neck was printed, and gave it to Korableva.
The latter looked at the picture, disapprovingly
shook her head, chiefly because Maslova spent money so
foolishly, and, lighting a cigarette over the lamp, inhaled
the smoke several times, then thrust it at Maslova. Maslova,
without ceasing to cry, eagerly began to inhale the
smoke.</p>

<p>"Penal servitude," she murmured, sobbing.</p>

<p>"They have no fear of God, these cursed blood-suckers!"
said Korableva. "They have condemned an innocent
girl."</p>

<p>At this moment there was a loud outburst of laughter
among those standing near the window. The delicate
laughter of the little girl mingled with the hoarse and
shrill laughter of the women. This merriment was
caused by some act of a prisoner without.</p>

<p>"Oh, the scoundrel! See what he is doing!" said the
red-headed woman, pressing her face against the grating,
her whole massive frame shaking.</p>

<p>"What is that drum-hide shouting about?" said Korableva,
shaking her head at the red-haired woman, and then
again turning to Maslova. "How many years?"</p>

<p>"Four," said Maslova, and the flow of her tears was so
copious that one of them fell on the cigarette. She
angrily crushed it, threw it away and took another.</p>

<p>The watch-woman, although she was no smoker, immediately
picked up the cigarette-end and began to
straighten it, talking at the same time.</p>

<p>"As I said to Matveievna, dear," she said, "it is ill-luck.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>They do what they please. And we thought they would
discharge you. Matveievna said you would be discharged,
and I said that you would not, I said. 'My
heart tells me,' I said, 'that they will condemn her,' and so
it happened," she went on, evidently listening to the
sounds of her own voice with particular pleasure.</p>

<p>The prisoners had now passed through the court-yard,
and the four women left the window and approached Maslova.
The larged-eyed illicit seller of spirits was the first
to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, is the sentence very severe?" she asked, seating
herself near Maslova and continuing to knit her stocking.</p>

<p>"It is severe because she has no money. If she had
money to hire a good lawyer, I am sure they would not
have held her," said Korableva. "That lawyer&mdash;what's
his name?&mdash;that clumsy, big-nosed one can, my dear
madam, lead one out of the water dry. That's the man
you should take."</p>

<p>"To hire him!" grinned Miss Dandy. "Why, he would
not look at you for less than a thousand rubles."</p>

<p>"It seems to be your fate," said the old woman who was
charged with incendiarism. "I should say he is severe!
He drove my boy's wife from her; put him in jail, and
me, too, in my old age," for the hundredth time she began
to repeat her story. "Prison and poverty are our lot.
If it is not prison, it is poverty."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is always the same with them," said the woman-moonshiner,
and, closely inspecting the girl's head, she
put her stocking aside, drew the girl over between her
overhanging legs and with dexterous fingers began to
search in her head. "Why do you deal in wine? But I
have to feed my children," she said, continuing her search.</p>

<p>These words reminded Maslova of wine.</p>

<p>"Oh, for a drop of wine," she said to Korableva, wiping
her tears with the sleeve of her shirt and sobbing from
time to time.</p>

<p>"Some booze? Why, of course!" said Korableva.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>


<p>Maslova produced the money from one of the lunch-rolls
and gave it to Korableva, who climbed up to the
draught-hole of the oven for a flask of wine she had hidden
there. Seeing which, those women who were not her
immediate neighbors went to their places. Meantime
Maslova shook the dust from her 'kerchief and coat,
climbed up on her cot and began to eat a roll.</p>

<p>"I saved some tea for you, but I fear it is cold," said
Theodosia, bringing down from a shelf a pot, wrapped in
a rag, and a tin cup.</p>

<p>The beverage was perfectly cold, and tasted more of tin
than of tea, but Maslova poured out a cupful and began
to drink.</p>

<p>"Here, Finashka!" she called, and breaking a piece from
the roll thrust it toward the boy, who gazed at her open-mouthed.</p>

<p>Korableva, meanwhile, brought the flask of wine. Maslova
offered some to Korableva and Miss Dandy. These
three prisoners constituted the aristocracy of the cell, because
they had money and divided among themselves
what they had.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Maslova became brighter and energetically
began to relate what had transpired at the court,
mockingly imitating the prosecutor and rehearsing such
parts as had appealed to her most. She was particularly
impressed by the fact that the men paid considerable attention
to her wherever she went. In the court-room
every one looked at her, she said, and for that purpose
constantly came into the prisoners' room.</p>

<p>"Even the guard said: 'It is to look at you that they
come here.' Some one would come and ask for some
document or something, but I saw that it was not for the
document that he came. He would devour me with his
eyes," she said, smiling and shaking her head as if perplexed.
"They are good ones!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is how it is," chimed in the watch-woman in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>her melodious voice. "They are like flies on sugar. If
you needed them for any other purpose, be sure they
would not come so quickly. They know a good thing
when they see it."</p>

<p>"It was the same here," interrupted Maslova. "As soon
as I was brought here I met with a party coming from the
depot. They gave me no rest, and I could hardly get rid
of them. Luckily the warden drove them off. One of
them bothered me particularly."</p>

<p>"How did he look?" asked Miss Dandy.</p>

<p>"He had a dark complexion, and wore a mustache."</p>

<p>"It is he."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Stchegloff. He passed here just now."</p>

<p>"Who is Stchegloff?"</p>

<p>"She don't know Stchegloff! He twice escaped from
Siberia. Now he has been caught, but he will escape
again. Even the officers fear him," said Miss Dandy, who
delivered notes to prisoners, and knew everything that
transpired in the jail. "He will surely escape."</p>

<p>"If he does he won't take either of us with him," said
Korableva. "You'd better tell me this: What did the
lawyer say to you about a petition&mdash;you must send one
now."</p>

<p>Maslova said that she did not know anything about a
petition.</p>

<p>At this moment the red-haired woman, burying her two
freckled hands into her tangled, thick hair, and scratching
her head with her nails, approached the wine-drinking
aristocrats.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, Katherine, everything," she began.
"First of all, you must write on paper: 'I am not satisfied
with the trial,' and then hand it to the prosecutor."</p>

<p>"What do you want here?" Korableva turned to her,
speaking in an angry basso. "You have smelled the wine!
We know you. We don't need your advice; we know
what we have to do."</p>

<p>"Who is talking to you?"</p>

<p>"You want some wine&mdash;that's what you want."</p>

<p>"Let her alone. Give her some," said Maslova, who always
divided with others what she had.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>"Yes, I will give her," and Korableva clenched her
fist.</p>

<p>"Try it! Try it!" moving toward Korableva, said the
red-haired woman. "I am not afraid of you."</p>

<p>"You jail bird!"</p>

<p>"You are another!"</p>

<p>"You gutter rake!"</p>

<p>"I am a rake&mdash;am I? You convict, murderess!"
shrieked the red-haired woman.</p>

<p>"Go away, I tell you!" said Korableva frowning.</p>

<p>But the red-haired woman only came nearer, and Korableva
gave her a push on the open, fat breast. The other
seemingly only waited for this, for with an unexpected,
quick movement of one hand she seized Korableva's hair
and was about to strike her in the face with the other,
when Korableva seized this hand. Maslova and Miss
Dandy sprang up and took hold of the hands of the red-haired
woman, endeavoring to release her hold on Korableva,
but the hand that clutched the hair would not open.
For a moment she released the hair, but only to wind it
around her fist. Korableva, her head bent, with one hand
kept striking her antagonist over the body and catching
the latter's hand with her teeth. The women crowded
around the fighters, parting them and shouting. Even
the consumptive came near them, and, coughing, looked
on. The children huddled together and cried. The noise
attracted the warden and the matron. They were finally
parted. Korableva loosened her gray braid and began
to pick out the pieces of torn hair, while the other held
the tattered remnant of her shirt to her breast&mdash;both
shouting, explaining and complaining against one another.</p>

<p>"I know it is the wine&mdash;I can smell it," said the matron.
"I will tell the superintendent to-morrow. Now, remove
everything, or there will be trouble. There is no time to
listen to you. To your places, and be silent!"</p>

<p>But for a long time there was no silence. The women
continued to curse each other; they began to relate how it
all commenced, and whose fault it was. The warden and
matron finally departed; the women quieted down and
took to their cots. The old woman stood up before the
image and began to pray.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>"Two Siberian convicts," suddenly said the red-haired
woman in a hoarse voice, accompanying every word with
a torrent of abuse.</p>

<p>"Look out, or you will get it again," quickly answered
Korableva, adding similar revilement. Then they became
silent.</p>

<p>"If they had not prevented me, I should have knocked
out your eyes," the red-haired one began again, and again
came a quick and sharp retort.</p>

<p>Then came another interval of silence, followed by more
abuse. The intervals became longer and longer, and
finally silence settled over the cell.</p>

<p>They were all falling asleep; some began to snore; only
the old woman, who always prayed for a long time, was
still bowing before the image, while the chanter's daughter,
as soon as the matron left the cell, came down from
her cot and began to walk up and down the cell.</p>

<p>Maslova was awake and incessantly thinking of herself
as a convict, the word which had been twice applied to
her&mdash;once by Bochkova, and again by the red-haired
woman. She could not be reconciled to the thought.
Korableva, who was lying with her back turned toward
Maslova, turned around.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of such a thing," she said, in a low
voice. "Others commit heaven knows what crimes, and
they go scot free, while I must suffer for nothing."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, girl. People live also in Siberia. You
will not be lost even there," Korableva consoled her.</p>

<p>"I know that I will not be lost, but it is painful to be
treated that way. I deserved a better fate. I am used
to a comfortable life."</p>

<p>"You can do nothing against God's will," Korableva
said, with a sigh. "You can do nothing against His
will."</p>

<p>"I know, auntie, but it is hard, nevertheless."</p>

<p>They became silent.</p>

<p>"Listen to that wanton," said Korableva, calling Maslova's
attention to the strange sounds that came from
the other end of the cell.</p>

<p>These sounds were the suppressed sobbing of the red-haired
woman. She wept because she had just been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>abused, beaten, and got no wine, for which she so yearned.
She also wept because her whole life was one round of
abuse, scorn, insults and blows. She meant to draw some
consolation from the recollection of her first love for the
factory hand, Fedka Molodenkoff, but, recalling this first
love, she also recalled the manner of its ending. The end
of it was that this Molodenkoff, while in his cups, by way
of jest, smeared her face with vitriol, and afterward
laughed with his comrades as he watched her writhing
in pain. She remembered this, and she pitied herself;
and, thinking that no one heard her, she began to weep,
and wept like a child&mdash;moaning, snuffling and swallowing
salty tears.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff rose the following morning with a consciousness
that some change had taken place within him,
and before he could recall what it was he already knew
that it was good and important.</p>

<p>"Katiousha&mdash;the trial. Yes, and I must stop lying, and
tell all the truth." And what a remarkable coincidence!
That very morning finally came the long-expected letter
of Maria Vasilievna, the wife of the marshal of the nobility&mdash;that
same letter that he wanted so badly now. She
gave him his liberty and wished him happiness in his
proposed marriage.</p>

<p>"Marriage!" he repeated ironically. "How far I am
from it!"</p>

<p>And his determination of the day before to tell everything
to her husband, to confess his sin before him, and
to hold himself ready for any satisfaction he might demand,
came to his mind. But this morning it did not
seem to him so easy as it had yesterday. "And then, what
is the good of making a man miserable? If he asks me,
I will tell him; but to call on him specially for that purpose&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;No,
it is not necessary."</p>

<p>It seemed to him equally difficult this morning to tell
all the truth to Missy. He thought it would be offering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>an insult. It was inevitable, as in all worldly affairs,
that there should remain something unexpressed but understood.
One thing, however, he decided upon this
morning&mdash;that he would not go there, and would tell the
truth when asked. But in his relations toward Katiousha
there was to be nothing unsaid.</p>

<p>"I will go to the jail&mdash;will tell her, beg of her to forgive
me. And, if necessary&mdash;yes, if necessary&mdash;I will marry
her," he thought.</p>

<p>The idea that for the sake of moral satisfaction he would
sacrifice everything and marry her this morning particularly
affected him.</p>

<p>It was a long time since he had risen with so much
energy in him. When Agrippina Petrovna entered his
room he declared to her with a determination which he
himself did not expect, that he had no further need of
the house, and that he would dispense with her services.
There was a tacit understanding that the large house was
kept up for his contemplated marriage. The closing up
of the house consequently had some particular significance.
Agrippina Petrovna looked at him with surprise.</p>

<p>"I thank you very much, Agrippina Petrovna, for your
solicitude in my behalf, but I do not now need such a
large house, or any of the servants. If you wish to help
me, then be so kind as to pack away the things as you
used to do in mamma's lifetime. Natasha will dispose of
them when she arrives." Natasha was Nekhludoff's
sister.</p>

<p>Agrippina Petrovna shook her head.</p>

<p>"Dispose of them? Why, they will be needed," she
said.</p>

<p>"No, they will not, Agrippina Petrovna&mdash;they will positively
not be needed," said Nekhludoff, answering what
she meant by shaking his head. "Please tell Kornei that
his salary will be paid for two months in advance, but
that I do not need him."</p>

<p>"You are wrong in doing this, Dmitri Ivanovich," she
said. "You will need a house even if you go abroad."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me, Agrippina Petrovna. I will
not go abroad, and if I do go, it will be to an entirely
different place."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>His face suddenly turned a purple color.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is necessary to tell her," he thought. "I must
tell all to everybody.</p>

<p>"A very strange and important thing has happened to
me. Do you remember Katiousha, who lived with Aunt
Maria Ivanovna?"</p>

<p>"Of course; I taught her to sew."</p>

<p>"Well, then, she was tried in court yesterday, and I
was one of the jury."</p>

<p>"Ah, good Lord! what a pity!" said Agrippina Petrovna.
"What was she tried for?"</p>

<p>"Murder, and it was all caused by me."</p>

<p>"How could you have caused it? You are talking very
strangely," said Agrippina Petrovna, and fire sparkled in
her old eyes.</p>

<p>She knew of the incident with Katiousha.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is my fault. And this causes me to change
my plans."</p>

<p>"What change can this cause in your plans?" said
Agrippina Petrovna, suppressing a smile.</p>

<p>"This: That since it was through my fault that she is
in her present condition, I consider it my duty to help
her to the extent of my ability."</p>

<p>"That is your affair, but I cannot see that you are so
much in fault. It happens to everybody, and if one is
guided by common sense the matter is usually arranged
and forgotten, and one lives on like the rest of the world,"
said Agrippina Petrovna, sternly and seriously. "There
is no reason why you should take it so much to heart.
I heard long ago that she had gone to the bad, so whose
fault is it?"</p>

<p>"It is my fault, and that is why I wish to make
amends."</p>

<p>"Well, it is hard to set that right."</p>

<p>"That is my affair. If you are thinking of yourself,
then that which mother wished&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of myself. Your deceased mother
showed me so many favors that I do not desire anything.
My niece, Lizauka, wishes me to come to her, so I will
go as soon as you need me no longer. Only you are taking
it too much to heart; it happens with everybody."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>"Well, I do not think so. I still ask you to help me
rent the house and pack away the things. And do not
be angry with me. I am very, very thankful to you for
everything."</p>

<p>It is remarkable that since Nekhludoff understood that
he was disgusted with himself, others ceased to be repulsive
to him. On the contrary, he had a kindly and respectful
feeling for Agrippina Petrovna and Kornei. He
wished to confess also before Kornei, but the latter was
so impressively respectful that he could not make up his
mind to do it.</p>

<p>On his way to the court, passing along the familiar
streets and in the same carriage, Nekhludoff was himself
surprised what a different man he felt himself to-day.</p>

<p>His marriage to Missy, which but yesterday seemed
to be so near, to-day appeared to him absolutely impossible.
Yesterday he understood his position to be such that
there could be no doubt that she would be happy to marry
him; to-day he felt himself unworthy not only of marrying
her, but of being her friend. "If she only knew who
I was, she would never receive me, and yet I taunted
her with coquetting with that gentleman. But no, even
if she married me I should never have peace, even though
I were happy, while that one is in jail, and may any day
be sent under escort to Siberia. While the woman whom
I have ruined is tramping the weary road to penal servitude,
I will be receiving congratulations, and paying visits
with my young wife. Or I will be counting the votes
for and against school inspection, etc., with the marshal,
whom I have shamefully deceived, and afterward make
appointments with his wife (what abomination!). Or I
will work on my picture, which will, evidently, never be
finished, for I had no business to occupy myself with such
trifles. And I can do neither of these things now," he
said to himself, happy at the inward change which he felt.</p>

<p>"First of all," he thought, "I must see the lawyer, and
then&mdash;then see her in jail&mdash;the convict of yesterday&mdash;and
tell her everything."</p>

<p>And when he thought how he would see her, confess his
guilt before her, how he would declare to her that he
would do everything in his power, marry her in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>wipe out his guilt, he became enraptured, and tears filled
his eyes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>


<p>Arriving at the court-house, Nekhludoff met the usher
in the corridor and asked him where the prisoners already
sentenced were kept, and from whom permission could be
obtained to see them. The usher told him that the prisoners
were kept in various places, and that before final
judgment the public prosecutor was the only person from
whom permission to see them could be obtained. "The
prosecutor has not arrived yet; when he does I will let
you know, and will escort you myself to him after the
session. And now, please to walk into the court. The
session is commencing."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff thanked the usher, who seemed to him
particularly pitiful to-day, and went into the jury-room.</p>

<p>As Nekhludoff was approaching the jury-room his fellow
jurors were coming out, repairing to the court-room.
The merchant was as cheerful, had lunched as well as
yesterday, and greeted Nekhludoff like an old friend.
The loud laughter and familiarity of Peter Gerasimovitch
did not give rise to-day in Nekhludoff of the unpleasant
sensation of yesterday.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff wished to tell all the jurymen of his relations
to the woman whom they had convicted yesterday.
"It would have been proper," he thought, "yesterday to
rise in court and publicly confess my guilt." But when
with the other jurymen he entered the court-room and
witnessed the same procedure, the same "Hear ye! Hear
ye!" the three judges in high collars on the elevation,
the silence, the seating of the jury on high-backed chairs,
the gendarmes, the priest&mdash;he felt that, though it was
necessary to do it, he would not have been able even yesterday
to break this solemnity.</p>

<p>They went through the same preliminaries, except the
swearing in of the jury and the justiciary's speech to them.</p>

<p>A case of burglary was before the court. The prisoner,
who was guarded by two gendarmes with unsheathed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>swords, was a twenty-year-old boy with a bloodless face
and in a gray coat. He sat alone on the prisoners' bench
and scanned from under his eyebrows all those that entered
the court-room. This boy and another were charged
with breaking the lock of a shed and stealing therefrom
mats of the value of three rubles and sixty-seven kopecks.
It appeared from the indictment that a policeman caught
the boy when he was walking with the other, who carried
the mats on his shoulder. Both of them immediately confessed,
and they were put in jail. The comrade of this
boy, a locksmith, died in jail, and he was tried alone. The
old mats lay on the table reserved for exhibits.</p>

<p>The case was conducted in the same order as yesterday,
with all the proofs, witnesses, experts, oath-taking, examinations
and cross-examinations. The policeman, when
questioned by the justiciary, complainant and the defense,
made listless answers&mdash;"Yes, sir," "Can't tell," and again
"Yes, sir"&mdash;but notwithstanding this, it was apparent that
he pitied the boy and testified involuntarily against him.</p>

<p>Another witness, a splenetic old man who owned those
mats, when asked if they belonged to him, unwillingly
testified that they were his. When, however, the prosecutor
asked him what use he intended to make of them,
and whether he needed them much, he became angry and
answered: "I wish they had been lost entirely, these mats.
I don't need them at all. And if I had known that you
would make so much fuss about them, I would gladly
have given ten rubles, or twenty, rather than be dragged
into court. I have spent five rubles on carriages coming
here and going back again. And I am sick; I am suffering
from rupture and rheumatism."</p>

<p>The prisoner admitted the charge against him, and, like
a trapped animal, stupidly looked now to one side, now
to the other, and in a halting voice related everything
as it happened.</p>

<p>It was a clear case, but the prosecutor, as he did yesterday,
raised his shoulders and propounded subtle questions
which were calculated to entrap the clever criminal.</p>

<p>In his speech he argued that the theft was committed
in a dwelling-house by breaking and entering it, and that
therefore the severest punishment should be meted out to
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Counsel for the defense, appointed by the court, argued
that the theft was committed not in a dwelling-house, and
that, though the prisoner pleaded guilty, he was not as
dangerous to society as the prosecutor would have them
believe.</p>

<p>The justiciary was the personification of impartiality
and justice, and endeavored to impress on the jury that
which they already knew and could not help knowing.
Again they took recesses and smoked cigarettes, and again
the usher shouted "Hear ye!" and the two gendarmes
sat trying to keep awake.</p>

<p>It developed during the trial that this boy had been
apprenticed in a tobacco factory, in which he worked five
years. This year he was discharged by his employer after
a misunderstanding with the employees, and, going idly
about the city, he spent all he had on drink. At an inn
he met a locksmith who had also been discharged and
was drinking hard, and the two went at night, while
drunk, to that shed, broke the lock, and took the first
thing they saw. They were caught, and as they confessed
they were imprisoned. The locksmith, while waiting
for a trial, died. The boy was now being tried as
a dangerous creature from whom it was necessary to protect
society.</p>

<p>"As dangerous a creature as the prisoner of yesterday,"
Nekhludoff thought while watching the proceedings.
"They are dangerous, but are we not dangerous? I am
a libertine, an impostor; and all of us, all those that know
me as I am, not only do not detest but respect me."</p>

<p>It is evident that this boy is no villain, but a very ordinary
person&mdash;every one sees that&mdash;and that he became
what he is only because he lived amid conditions that
beget such people. It is therefore plain that such boys
will exist as long as the conditions producing these unfortunates
remain unchanged. If any one had taken pity
on this boy, Nekhludoff thought while looking at the sickly,
frightened face of the boy, before want had driven him
from the village to the city, and relieved that want, or,
when, after twelve hours' work in the factory, he was
visiting inns with grown-up comrades, some one had told
him, "Don't go, Vania; it is bad," the boy would not have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>gone, or got drunk, and the burglary would never have
occurred.</p>

<p>But no one pitied the boy during the time that he, like
an animal, spent his school years in the city, and, with
close-cropped hair, to prevent his getting vermin, ran errands
for the workmen. On the contrary, the only thing
he had heard from the workmen and his comrades was
to the effect that a brave fellow was he who cheated,
drank, reviled, fought, or led a depraved life.</p>

<p>And when, sickly and depraved from the unhealthy
work, from drink and lewdness, foolish and capricious,
he aimlessly prowled around the city, as in a dream, entered
some shed and abstracted a few worthless mats,
then, instead of destroying the causes that led this boy
into his present condition, we intend to mend matters by
punishing him!</p>

<p>It is dreadful!</p>

<p>Thus Nekhludoff thought, and no longer listened to
what was going on around him. He was himself terrified
at this revelation. He wondered why he had not seen
it before&mdash;how others failed to see it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>


<p>As soon as the first recess was taken, Nekhludoff rose
and went out of the court, intending to return no more.
They might do with him what they pleased, but he could
no longer take part in that farce.</p>

<p>Having inquired where the prosecutor's room was, he
directed his steps toward that dignitary. The messenger
would not admit him, declaring that the prosecutor was
busy, but Nekhludoff brushed past him and asked an
officer who met him to announce him to the prosecutor,
saying that he was on important business. His title and
dress helped Nekhludoff. The officer announced him, and
he was admitted. The prosecutor received him standing,
evidently dissatisfied with Nekhludoff's persistence in
seeking an audience with him.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" the prosecutor asked, sternly.</p>

<p>"I am a juryman, my name is Nekhludoff, and I want
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>to see the prisoner Maslova," he said, resolutely and quickly.
He blushed, and felt that his act would have a decisive
influence on his life.</p>

<p>The prosecutor was a tall, swarthy man with short hair
just turning gray, bright eyes and a trimmed, bushy beard
on the protruding lower jaw.</p>

<p>"Maslova? Yes, I know her. She was charged with
poisoning," he said calmly. "Why do you want to see
her?" And then, as if desiring to soften his harsh demeanor,
he added: "I cannot give you the permission before
I know what you want to see her for."</p>

<p>"It is very important for me to see her," Nekhludoff
burst out.</p>

<p>"I see," said the prosecutor, and, raising his eyes, looked
intently at Nekhludoff. "Has her case been tried?"</p>

<p>"She was tried yesterday and sentenced to four years'
penal servitude. The conviction was irregular; she is
innocent."</p>

<p>"I see. If she has only been sentenced yesterday," said
the prosecutor without paying attention to Nekhludoff's
declaration about her innocence, "then she will be detained
until final judgment in the place where she is now. The
jail is open to visitors on certain days only. I advise
you to apply there."</p>

<p>"But I must see her as soon as possible," with trembling
lower jaw Nekhludoff said, feeling that a critical moment
was approaching.</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious about seeing her?" the prosecutor
asked, raising his eyebrows with some alarm.</p>

<p>"Because she is innocent of the crime for which she
was sentenced to penal servitude. The guilt is mine, not
hers," Nekhludoff said in a trembling voice, feeling that
he was saying what he should not.</p>

<p>"How so?" asked the prosecutor.</p>

<p>"I deceived her, and brought her to the condition in
which she is now. If I had not driven her to the position
in which she was, she would not have been charged here
with such a crime."</p>

<p>"Still I fail to see what all this has to do with visiting
her."</p>

<p>"It has, because I want to follow her and&mdash;marry her,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>said Nekhludoff. And, as it usually happened when he
spoke of this, his eyes filled with tears.</p>

</p>

<p>"Ah, is that so?" said the prosecutor. "This is really
an exceptional case. Are you not a member of the Krasnopersk
town council?" asked the prosecutor, as if recalling
that he had heard of this Nekhludoff who was
now making such a strange statement.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but I fail to see what this has to do with
my request," fuming, Nekhludoff answered with rancor.</p>

<p>"Nothing, of course," the prosecutor said, with a faint
smile on his face, and not in the least disturbed. "But
your request is so unusual and beside all customary
forms&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, can I get the permission?"</p>

<p>"Permission? Why, yes. I will give you a pass immediately.
Please be seated."</p>

<p>He went to the table, sat down and began to write.</p>

<p>"Please be seated."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff stood still.</p>

<p>When he had made out the pass the prosecutor handed
it to Nekhludoff and eyed him with curiosity.</p>

<p>"I must also tell you," said Nekhludoff, "that I cannot
continue to serve as juror."</p>

<p>"As you know, satisfactory reasons must be given to
the court in such cases."</p>

<p>"The reasons are that I consider all courts useless and
immoral."</p>

<p>"I see," said the prosecutor, with the same faint smile
which seemed to indicate that such statements were familiar
to him, and belonged to an amusing class of people
well known to him. "I see, but you understand that, as
public prosecutor, I cannot agree with you. I therefore
advise you to state so to the court, which will either find
your reasons satisfactory or unsatisfactory, and in the
latter case will impose a fine on you. Apply to the court."</p>

<p>"I have already stated my reasons, and I will not go
there," Nekhludoff said angrily.</p>

<p>"I have the honor to salute you," said the prosecutor,
bowing, evidently desiring to rid himself of the strange
visitor.</p>

<p>"Who was the man that just left your room?" asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>one of the judges who entered the prosecutor's cabinet
after Nekhludoff had left.</p>

<p>"Nekhludoff. You know, the one who made such
strange suggestions in the Krasnopersk town council.
Just imagine, he is on the jury, and among the prisoners
there was a woman, or girl, who was sentenced to penal
servitude, and who, he says, was deceived by him. And
now he wishes to marry her."</p>

<p>"It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"That is what he told me. And how strangely excited
he was!"</p>

<p>"There is something wrong with our young men."</p>

<p>"He is not so very young."</p>

<p>"What a bore your famous Ivasheukoff is, my dear!
He wins his cases by tiring us out&mdash;there is no end to
his talking."</p>

<p>"They must be curbed, or they become real obstructionists."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>


<p>From the public prosecutor Nekhludoff went straight
to the detention-house. But no one by the name of Maslova
was there. The inspector told him that she might
be found in the old temporary prison. Nekhludoff went
there and found that Katherine <a name="prison_list" id="prison_list"></a>Moslova was one of the
inmates.</p>

<p>The distance between the detention-house and the old
prison was great, and Nekhludoff did not arrive there
until toward evening. He was about to open the door of
the huge, gloomy building, when the guard stopped him
and rang the bell. The warden responded to the bell.
Nekhludoff showed the pass, but the warden told him that
he could not be admitted without authority from the inspector.
While climbing the stairs to the inspector's
dwelling, Nekhludoff heard the sounds of an intricate
bravura played on the piano. And when the servant, with
a handkerchief tied around one eye, opened the door, a
flood of music dazed his senses. It was a tiresome rhapsody
by Lizst, well played, but only to a certain place.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>When that place was reached, the melody repeated itself.
Nekhludoff asked the servant if the inspector was in.</p>

<p>The servant said that he was not.</p>

<p>"Will he be in soon?"</p>

<p>The rhapsody again ceased, and with a noisy flourish
again repeated itself.</p>

<p>"I will go and inquire." And the servant went away.</p>

<p>The rhapsody again went on at full speed, when suddenly,
reaching a certain point, it came to a stand-still and
a voice from within was heard.</p>

<p>"Tell him that he is not home, and will not come to-day.
He is visiting&mdash;why do they bother us?" a woman's
voice was heard to say, and the rhapsody continued, then
ceased, and the sound of a chair moved back was heard.
The angry pianist herself evidently wished to reprimand
the importunate visitor who came at such a late hour.</p>

<p>"Papa is not home," angrily said a pale, wretched looking
girl with puffed-up hair and blue spots under her
eyes, who came to the door. Seeing a young man in a
good overcoat, she became calm. "Walk in, please.
What do you wish to see him for?"</p>

<p>"I would like to see a prisoner. I hold a pass from the
prosecutor."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; papa is not in. Why, walk in,
please," she again called from the entrance hall. "Or
apply to his assistant, who is now in the office. You may
talk to him. And what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Nekhludoff, without answering the
question, and went away.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the door closed when the same vigorous,
merry sound, so inappropriate to the place and so persistently
rehearsed by the wretched girl, was heard. In
the court-yard Nekhludoff met a young officer with a
stiff, dyed mustache, of whom he inquired for the assistant.
He himself was the assistant. He took the pass,
looked at it, and said that he could not admit any one
to the prison on a pass for the detention-house. Besides,
it was late.</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock to-morrow the prison is open to all
visitors, and the inspector will be here. You could then
see her in the common reception-room, or, if the inspector
permits it, in the office."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>So, without gaining an interview, Nekhludoff returned
home. Agitated by the expectation of seeing her, he
walked along the streets, thinking not of the court, but
of his conversations with the prosecutor and the inspectors.
That he was seeking an interview with her,
and told the prosecutor of his intention, and visited two
prisons preparing for the ordeal, had so excited him that
he could not calm down. On returning home he immediately
brought forth his unused diary, read some parts
and made the following entry: "For two years I have kept
no diary, and thought that I should never again return
to this childishness. But it was no childishness, but a
discourse with myself, with that true, divine <i>I</i> which
lives in every man. All this time this <i>I</i> was slumbering
and I had no one to discourse with. It was awakened
by the extraordinary event of the 28th of April, in court,
where I sat as jurymen. I saw her, Katiousha, whom I
had deceived, on the prisoners' bench, in a prison coat.
Through a strange misunderstanding and my mistake, she
was sentenced to penal servitude. I have just returned
from the prosecutor and the prison. I was not permitted
to see her, but I am determined to do anything to see
her, acknowledge my guilt and make reparation even by
marrying her. Lord, help me! My soul is rejoicing."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>


<p>For a long time that night Maslova lay awake with
open eyes, and, looking at the door, mused.</p>

<p>She was thinking that under no circumstances would
she marry a convict on the island of Saghalin, but would
settle down some other way&mdash;with some inspector, or
clerk, or even the warden, or an assistant. They are all
eager for such a thing. "Only I must not get thin.
Otherwise I am done for." And she recalled how she was
looked at by her lawyer, the justiciary&mdash;in fact, everybody
in the court-room. She recalled how Bertha, who visited
her in prison, told her that the student, whom she loved
while she was an inmate at Kitaeva's, inquired about her
and expressed his regrets when told of her condition.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>She recalled the fight with the red-haired woman, and
pitied her. She called to mind the baker who sent her
an extra lunch roll, and many others, but not Nekhludoff.
Of her childhood and youth, and especially of her love
for Nekhludoff, she never thought. That was too painful.
These recollections were hidden deeply in her soul.
She never saw Nekhludoff even in a dream. She failed
to recognize him in court, not so much because when she
last saw him he was an army officer, beardless, with
small mustache and thick, short hair, while now he was
no longer young in appearance, and wore a beard, but
more because she never thought of him. She had buried
all recollections of her past relations with him in that terrible
dark night when, on his return from the army, he
visited his aunts.</p>

<p>Up to that night, while she hoped for his return, the
child which she bore under her heart was not irksome
to her. But from that night forward everything changed,
and the coming child was only a hindrance.</p>

<p>The aunts had asked Nekhludoff to stop off at their
station and call on them, but he wired that he would not
be able to do it, as he had to reach St. Petersburg in time.
When Katiousha learned this, she decided to go to the
railroad station to see him. The train was to pass at
two o'clock in the morning. Katiousha helped the ladies
to bed, and, having induced the cook's girl, Mashka, to
accompany her, she put on an old pair of shoes, threw a
shawl over her head, gathered up her skirts and ran to
the station.</p>

<p>It was a dark, rainy, windy, autumn night. The rain
now poured down in large, warm drops, now ceased. The
road could not be distinguished in the field, and it was
pitch dark in the woods. Although Katiousha was familiar
with the road she lost her way in the woods, and reached
a sub-station, where the train only stopped for three minutes.
Running on the platform, she espied Nekhludoff
through the window of a first-class car. The car was
brightly illuminated. Two officers sat on plush seats
playing cards. On the table near the window two thick
candles were burning. Nekhludoff sat on the arm of the
seat, his elbow resting on the back, laughing. As soon
as she recognized him she tapped on the window with her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>cold hand. But at that moment the third bell rang, and
the train began to move, the cars jostling each other forward.
One of the players rose with the cards in his hands
and began to look through the window. She tapped
again, and pressed her face against the window-pane.
At that moment the car beside which she stood was tugged
forward, and it moved along. She ran alongside, looking
in the window. The officer tried to lower the window,
but could not. Nekhludoff rose, and, pushing the officer
aside, began lowering it. The train went faster, so that
Katiousha was obliged to run. The train moved still faster
when the window was lowered. At that moment the conductor
pushed her aside and jumped on the car. She
fell back, but continued to run along the wet boards of
the platform, and when she reached the end of the platform
and began to descend the steps to the ground, she
almost fell exhausted. The first-class car was far ahead
of her, and while she was running the second-class cars
passed her, then came with greater speed those of the
third class. When the last car with the lanterns flew by
her she was already beyond the water-tank, unsheltered
from the wind which lashed her, blowing the shawl from
her head and tangling her feet in her skirt. But still
she ran on.</p>

<p>"Aunt Michaelovna!" shouted the little girl, "you have
lost your shawl."</p>

<p>Katiousha stopped, threw back her head, and, covering
her face with her hands, began to sob.</p>

<p>"He is gone!" she cried.</p>

<p>"While he is in a lighted car, sitting on a plush seat,
jesting and drinking, I stand here in the mud, rain and
wind, crying," she thought. She sat down on the ground
and began to sob aloud. The little girl was frightened,
and, embracing her wet clothing, she said:</p>

<p>"Auntie, let's go home."</p>

<p>"I will wait for the next train, throw myself under the
wheels, and that will end it all," Katiousha was meanwhile
thinking, not heeding the girl.</p>

<p>She made up her mind to carry out her intention. But
as it always happens in the first moment of calm after
a period of agitation, the child, <i>his</i> child, suddenly shuddered.
Immediately all that which so tortured her that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>she was willing to die, all her wrath and her desire to
revenge herself even by death, passed. She became calm,
arranged her clothing, put the shawl on her head, and
went away.</p>

<p>She returned home exhausted, wet and muddy. From
that day began in her that spiritual transformation which
ended in her present condition. From that terrible night
on she ceased to believe in God and in goodness. Before
that night she herself believed in God, and believed that
other people believed in Him; but after that night she
became convinced that no one believed, and all that was
said of God and His law was false and wrong. The
one whom she loved, and who loved her&mdash;she knew it&mdash;abandoned
her and made sport of her feelings. And he
was the best of all the men she knew. All the others were
even worse. This she saw confirmed in all that had happened.
His aunts, pious old ladies, drove her out when
she was no longer as useful as she used to be. All the
women with whom she came in contact tried to make
money by her; the men, beginning with the commissary
and down to the prison officers, all looked upon her as
a means of pleasure. The whole world was after pleasure.
Her belief in this was strengthened by the old author
whom she met during the second year of her independent
life. He had told her frankly that this&mdash;he called it
poetical and esthetic&mdash;is all of life's happiness.</p>

<p>Every one lived for himself only, for his own pleasure,
and all the words about God and goodness were deception.
And if the questions sometimes occurred to her, Why
were the affairs of the world so ill arranged that people
harm each other, and all suffer, she thought it best not
to dwell on it. If she became lonesome, she took a drink,
smoked a cigarette, and the feeling would pass away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>


<p>When at five o'clock the following morning, which was
Sunday, the customary whistle blew, Korableva, who was
already awake, roused Maslova.</p>

<p>"A convict," Maslova thought with horror, rubbing her
eyes and involuntarily inhaling the foul morning air. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>wished to fall asleep again, to transfer herself into a state
of unconsciousness, but fear overcame her drowsiness.
She raised herself, crossed her legs under her, and looked
around. The women were already up, only the children
were still sleeping. The moonshining woman with bulging
eyes was carefully removing her coat from under
them. The rioter was drying near the oven some rags
which served for swaddling cloths, while the child, in the
hands of the blue-eyed Theodosia, was crying at the top
of its lungs, the woman lulling it in a gentle voice. The
consumptive, seizing her breast, coughed violently, and,
sighing at intervals, almost screamed. The red-headed
woman lay prone on her back relating a dream she had
had. The old incendiary stood before the image, whispering
the same words, crossing herself and bowing. The
chanter's daughter sat motionless on her cot, and with
dull, half-open eyes was looking into space. Miss Dandy
was curling on her finger her oily, rough, black hair.</p>

<p>Presently resounding steps were heard in the corridor,
the lock creaked open, and two prisoners in short jackets
and gray trousers scarcely reaching their ankles entered,
and, raising the ill-smelling vat on a yoke, carried it away.
The women went to the faucets in the corridor to wash
themselves. The red-headed woman got into a quarrel
with a woman from the adjoining cell. Again there were
cursing, shouting and complaints.</p>

<p>"You will get into the dark-room yet," shouted the
warden, and he slapped the red-headed woman on her
fat, bare back, so that it resounded through the entire
corridor. "Don't let me hear you again."</p>

<p>"Fooling again, you old man?" she said, treating it as
a caress.</p>

<p>"Hurry up! It is time for mass."</p>

<p>Scarcely had Maslova arranged her hair when the inspector
entered with his attendants.</p>

<p>"Make ready for inspection!" shouted the warden.</p>

<p>The women of the two cells formed in two rows along
the corridor, those of the back row placing their hands
on the shoulders of the women in the front row. Then
they were counted.</p>

<p>After the count came the woman inspector and led the
prisoners to the church. Maslova and Theodosia were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>in the middle of the column, which consisted of over a
hundred women from all the cells. They all had white
'kerchiefs on their heads, and some few wore their own
colored dresses. These were the wives and children of
convicts. The procession covered the whole stairway. A
soft clatter of prison shoes was heard, here and there
some conversation, and sometimes laughter. At a turn
Maslova noticed the malicious face of her enemy,
Bochkova, who was walking in the front row, and pointed
her out to Theodosia. At the foot of the stairs the women
became silent, and, making the sign of the cross and
bowing, they filed into the open door of the empty, gold-bedecked
chapel. Their place was on the right, where,
crowding each other, they began to arrange themselves
in rows, standing. Behind the women came the male convicts
who were serving terms or detained for transportation
under sentence by the communities. Loudly clearing
their throats, they formed a dense crowd on the left and
the middle of the chapel. Above, on the gallery, were
other convicts with heads half shaven, whose presence was
manifested by a clanking of chains.</p>

<p>This prison chapel had been rebuilt and remodeled by
a rich merchant, who had spent about thirty thousand
rubles on it, and it was all ornamented with gilt and
bright colors.</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was silence, which was broken
only by the blowing of noses, coughing, and clanking of
chains. Suddenly the prisoners who stood in the middle
began to press back, making a passage for the inspector,
who walked to the middle of the chapel, and the services
commenced.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff left the house early. A peasant was driving
along a side alley, shouting in a strange voice: "Milk!
milk! milk!"</p>

<p>The first warm, spring rain had fallen the evening before.
Wherever there was a patch of unpaved ground
the green grass burst forth; the lindens were covered
with green nap; the fowl-cherry and poplar unfolded their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>long, fragrant leaves. In the market-place, through which
Nekhludoff had to pass, dense crowds in rags swarmed
before the tents, some carrying boots under their arms,
others smoothly pressed trousers and vests on their shoulders.</p>

<p>The working people were already crowding near the
traktirs (tea-houses), the men in clean, long coats gathered
in folds in the back of the waist, and in shining boots;
the women in bright-colored silk shawls and cloaks with
glass-bead trimmings. Policemen, with pistols attached
to yellow cords fastened around their waists, stood at
their posts. Children and dogs played on the grass-plots,
and gay nurses sat chatting on the benches.</p>

<p>On the streets, the left sides of which were yet cool,
moist and shady, heavy carts and light cabs rumbled and
jostled, the tram-cars rang their bells. The air was
agitated by the pealing of the church-bells summoning
the people to mass.</p>

<p>The driver stopped at a turn some distance from the
prison. A few men and women stood around, most of
them with bundles in their hands. To the right stood a
few frame houses; to the left a two-story building over
which hung a large sign. The large prison itself was
directly in front. An armed soldier walked to and fro
challenging every one attempting to pass him.</p>

<p>At the gate of the frame buildings sat the warden in
uniform, with an entry booklet in his hand. He made
entries of visitors and those whom they wished to see.
Nekhludoff approached him, gave his name and that of
<a name="that_name" id="that_name"></a>Moslova, and the officer entered them in his book.</p>

<p>"Why don't they open the door?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"The morning service is on. As soon as it is over you
will be admitted."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff returned among the waiting crowd.</p>

<p>A man in threadbare clothing, rumpled hat and slippers
on his bare feet, and his face full of red lines, pushed his
way through the crowd and walked toward the prison
door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" shouted the soldier.</p>

<p>"What are you bawling about?" answered the man, entirely
undisturbed by the soldier's challenge. "If I can't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>go in, I will wait. No use bawling as if you were a
general."</p>

<p>The crowd laughed approvingly. Most of the visitors
were poorly dressed, even ragged, but, judging by outward
appearance, there were also some decent men and
women among them. Beside Nekhludoff stood a well-dressed
man, clean shaven, stout and with rosy cheeks,
who carried a bundle of what looked like linen. Nekhludoff
asked him if that was his first visit. The man answered
that he came there every Sunday, and they entered
into conversation. He was an employee of a bank,
whose brother was under indictment for forgery. This
kind-hearted man told Nekhludoff all his story, and was
about to ask him about his own when their attention was
attracted by a rubber-tired carriage drawn by a blooded
chestnut horse. The carriage was occupied by a student
and a lady whose face was hidden under a veil. The
student alighted, holding in his hand a large bundle. He
approached Nekhludoff and asked him where and how he
should deliver the loaves of bread he had brought for
the prisoners. "I brought them at the request of my
bride. That is my bride. Her parents advised us to
bring some alms for the prisoners."</p>

<p>"I really don't know, for I am here for the first time,
but I think that that officer will tell you," said Nekhludoff,
pointing to the warden in the crown-laced uniform.</p>

<p>While Nekhludoff was talking to the student the large
iron gate of the prison opened and a uniformed officer
with another warden came out. The one with the booklet
in his hand announced that the prison was open for
visitors. The guard stood aside, and all the visitors, as
if fearing to be late, with quick step, and some even running,
pressed toward the prison gate. One of the wardens
stationed himself at the gate, and in a loud voice counted
the passing visitors&mdash;16, 17, 18, etc. The other warden,
within the gate, touching each with his hand, also counted
the visitors as they entered another door. This was to
make sure that at their departure no visitor remained in
prison, and no prisoner made his way out. The tallying
officer, without regard to the person of the visitor, slapped
Nekhludoff on the back. This at first offended the latter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>but he immediately remembered his mission, and he became
ashamed that his feelings should be thus wounded.</p>

<p>The second door opened into a large, vaulted room with
small iron-grated windows. In this room, which was
called the meeting-room, Nekhludoff saw in a niche a
large image of the Crucifixion.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff went on slowly, letting the hurrying visitors
pass before, and experienced a mingled feeling of horror
at the malefactors imprisoned in this jail, compassion for
those innocent people who, like the boy and Katiousha,
must be here, and timidity and tenderness before the meeting
that was before him. When he reached the end of
the room the warden said something, but Nekhludoff,
who was absorbed in his thoughts, paid no attention to
it, and followed in the direction led by the crowd, that is,
to the men's ward instead of the women's.</p>

<p>Letting the hurrying visitors pass, he walked into the
next room designated for interviews. On opening the
door he was struck by the deafening shouts of a hundred
throats turned into a continuous humming noise.
Only as he neared the people, who, like flies swarming on
sugar pressed their faces against a net which divided the
room in two, did Nekhludoff understand the cause of the
noise. This room with windows in the rear wall was
divided in two not by one, but by two wire nets which
stretched from the ceiling to the floor. Two wardens
walked between the nets. The prisoners were on the
other side of the nets, between which there was a space
of about seven feet for visitors, so that not only was it
difficult to converse with them but a short-sighted man
could not even see the face of the prisoner he was visiting.
In order to be heard, it was necessary to shout at the
top of one's voice. On both sides, pressing against the
nets, were the faces of wives, husbands, fathers, mothers,
children, who endeavored to see and speak to each other.
But as every one tried to speak so that he could be heard
by the person spoken to, and his neighbor did the same,
their voices interfered with each other, and each
tried to outcry the other. The result was the noise which
astonished Nekhludoff when he entered the room. It was
absolutely impossible to understand the conversations.
Only by the expression of the people's faces could one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>judge what they were speaking about, and what relation
the speakers sustained toward each other. Near Nekhludoff
was an old woman with a small 'kerchief on her head,
who, with trembling chin, shouted to a pale young man
with head half shaven. The prisoner, knitting his brow,
was listening to her with raised eyebrows. Beside the
old woman stood a young man in a long coat, who was
nodding his head while listening to a prisoner with a
weary face and beard turning gray, who greatly resembled
him. Further on stood a ragamuffin waving his hand,
shouting and laughing. On the floor beside this man sat
a woman in a good woolen dress, with a child in her arms.
She wept bitterly, evidently seeing for the first time that
gray-haired man on the other side of the net, manacled,
in a prison jacket, and with head half shaven. Over this
woman stood the bank employee shouting at the top of his
voice to a bald-headed prisoner with shining eyes.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff remained in this room about five minutes,
experiencing a strange feeling of anguish, a consciousness
of his impotence at the discord in the world, and he
was seized with a sensation like a rocking on board of a
ship.</p>

<p>"But I must fulfill my mission," he said to himself,
taking heart. "What am I to do?"</p>

<p>As he looked around for some officer, he saw a middle-sized
man with mustache, wearing epaulets, who was
walking behind the crowd.</p>

<p>"Sir, could you not tell me where the women are kept,
and where it is permitted to see them?" he asked, making
a particular effort to be polite.</p>

<p>"You wish to go to the women's ward?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I would like to see one of the women prisoners,"
Nekhludoff said, with the same strained politeness.</p>

<p>"You should have said so in the meeting-room. Whom
do you wish to see, then?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see Katherine Maslova."</p>

<p>"Has she been sentenced?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she was sentenced the other day," he said humbly,
as if fearing to ruffle the temper of the officer, who seemed
to be interested in him.</p>

<p>"Then this way, please," said the inspector, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>evidently decided from Nekhludoff's appearance that he
deserved attention. "Sidoroff!" he turned to a warrant-officer
wearing a mustache, and medals on his breast.
"Show this gentleman to the women's ward."</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>At that moment heart-rending cries came from the
direction of the grating.</p>

<p>All this seemed strange to Nekhludoff, and strangest of
all was that he was obliged to thank and feel himself
under obligation to the inspector and warden.</p>

<p>The warden led Nekhludoff from the men's ward into
the corridor, and through the open door opposite admitted
him to the women's meeting-room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL.</h2>


<p>This room, like the one in the men's ward, was also divided
in three, by two nets, but it was considerably
smaller. There were also fewer visitors and fewer prisoners,
but the noise was as great as in the men's room.
Here, also, the authorities stood guard between the nets.
The authorities were here represented by a matron in uniform
with crown-laced sleeves and fringed with blue braid
and a belt of the same color. Here, too, people pressed
against the nets&mdash;in the passage&mdash;city folks in divers
dresses; behind the nets, female prisoners, some in white,
others in their own dresses. The whole net was lined with
people. Some stood on tip-toe, speaking over the heads
of others; others, again, sat on the floor and conversed.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of the women prisoners, both in
her shouting and appearance, was a thin, ragged gipsy,
with a 'kerchief which had slipped from her head, who
stood almost in the middle of the room, near a post, behind
the net, gesticulating and shouting to a short and tightly
belted gipsy in a blue coat. A soldier sat beside him on
the floor, talking to a prisoner. Beyond stood a young
peasant with a light beard and in bast shoes, pressing his
flushed face to the net, evidently with difficulty suppressing
his tears. He was talking to a pretty, light-haired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>prisoner who gazed at him with her bright, blue eyes.
This was Theodosia, with her husband. Beside them
stood a tramp, who was talking to a disheveled, broad-faced
woman. Further on there were two women, a
man, and again a woman, and opposite each was a prisoner.
Maslova was not among them. But behind the
prisoners stood another woman. Nekhludoff felt the
beating of his heart increasing and his breath failing him.
The decisive moment was approaching. He neared the
net and recognized Katiousha. She stood behind the
blue-eyed Theodosia, and, smiling, listened to her conversation.
She did not wear the prison coat, but a white
waist, tightly belted, and rising high above the breast.
As in the court, her black hair hung in curls over her
'kerchiefed forehead.</p>

<p>"It will all be over in a moment," he thought. "Shall
I address her, or shall I wait till she addresses me?"</p>

<p>But she did not address him. She was waiting for
Clara, and never thought that that man came to see her.</p>

<p>"Whom do you wish to see?" the matron asked
Nekhludoff, approaching him.</p>

<p>"Katherine Maslova," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Maslova, you are wanted," shouted the matron.</p>

<p>Maslova turned round, raised her head, and with the
familiar expression of submissiveness, came to the net.
She did not recognize Nekhludoff, and gazed at him in
surprise. However, judging by his dress that he was
a rich man, she smiled.</p>

<p>"What are you?" she asked, pressing her smiling face
with squinting eyes against the net.</p>

<p>"I wish to see&mdash;" He did not know whether to use the
respectful "you" or the endearing "thou," and decided on
the former. He spoke no louder than usual. "I wish
to see you&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't give me any of your song and dance&mdash;&mdash;" the
tramp beside him shouted. "Did you take it, or did
you not?"</p>

<p>"She is dying; she is very weak," some one shouted
on the other side.</p>

<p>Maslova could not hear Nekhludoff, but the expression
of his face, as she spoke, suddenly reminded her of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>which she did not wish to think of. The smile disappeared
from her face, and a wrinkle on her brow evidenced
her suffering.</p>

<p>"I cannot hear what you are saying," she shouted,
blinking and still more knitting her brows.</p>

<p>"I came&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am doing my duty; I am repenting," thought
Nekhludoff, and immediately tears filled his eyes, and he
felt a choking sensation in his throat. His fingers
clutched at the net and he made efforts to keep from
sobbing.</p>

<p>"I should not have gone if you were well," came from
one side.</p>

<p>"I swear by God I know nothing about it!" cried a
prisoner from the other side.</p>

<p>Maslova noticed his agitation, and it communicated
itself to her. Her eyes sparkled, and her puffy, white
cheeks became covered with red spots, but her face retained
its severity, and her squinting eyes stared past
him.</p>

<p>"You are like him, but I don't know you," she shouted.</p>

<p>"I came here to ask your forgiveness," he said in a
loud voice, without intonation, as if repeating a lesson he
had learned by heart.</p>

<p>As he said these words he felt ashamed and looked
round. But the thought immediately came to his mind
that it was well that he was ashamed, for he ought to bear
the shame. And in a loud voice he continued:</p>

<p>"I acted meanly, infamously&mdash;forgive me."</p>

<p>She stood motionless, her squinting eyes fixed on him.</p>

<p>He could not continue and left the net, making efforts
to stifle the sobbing which was convulsing his breast.</p>

<p>The inspector who directed Nekhludoff to the women's
ward, evidently becoming interested in him, came into
the room, and, seeing him in the middle of the passage,
asked him why he was not speaking with the prisoner
he had inquired about. Nekhludoff blew his nose, and,
endeavoring to assume an air of calmness, said:</p>

<p>"I can't speak through the net; nothing can be heard."</p>

<p>The inspector mused awhile.</p>

<p>"Well, then, she can be brought out for awhile."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>"Maria Karlovna!" he turned to the matron. "Lead
Maslova out."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>


<p>A moment afterward Maslova came out through a
side door. With gentle step she came up to Nekhludoff;
stopped and glanced at him from under her lowered eyebrows.
Her black hair stood out on her forehead in
curly ringlets; her unhealthy, bloated, white face was
pretty and very calm, only her shining-black, squinting
eyes sparkled from under their swollen lashes.</p>

<p>"You may talk here," said the inspector and went aside.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff moved toward a bench standing beside the
wall.</p>

<p>Maslova glanced inquiringly at the inspector, and
shrugging her shoulders, as if in wonder, followed
Nekhludoff to the bench, and straightening her skirt, sat
down beside him.</p>

<p>"I know that it is hard for you to forgive me," began
Nekhludoff, but feeling the tears flooding his eyes, again
stopped, "but if the past cannot be mended, I will do now
everything in my power. Tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did you find me?" she asked without answering
his question, her squinting eyes looking and not looking
at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! Help me, teach me what to do!" Nekhludoff
said to himself as he looked at her face so completely
changed.</p>

<p>"I was on the jury when you were tried," he said.
"You did not recognize me?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not. I had no time to recognize you. Besides,
I did not look," she answered.</p>

<p>"Wasn't there a child?" he asked, and he felt his face
turning red.</p>

<p>"It died at that time, thank God," she said with bitterness,
turning away her head.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"I was ill myself&mdash;nearly died," she said without raising
her eyes.</p>

<p>"How could the aunts let you go?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>"Who would keep a servant with a child? As soon as
they noticed it they drove me out. But what is the use
of talking! I don't remember anything. It is all over
now."</p>

<p>"No, it is not over. I cannot leave it thus. I now
wish to atone for my sin."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to atone for; what's gone is gone,"
she said, and, all unexpected to him, she suddenly looked
at him and smiled in an alluring and piteous manner.</p>

<p>His appearance was entirely unexpected to Maslova,
especially at this time and place, and therefore the astonishment
of the first moment brought to her mind that
of which she never thought before. At the first moment
she hazily recalled that new, wonderful world of
feeling and thought which had been opened to her by
that charming young man who loved her, and whom she
loved, and then his inexplicable cruelty and the long
chain of humiliation and suffering which followed as the
direct result of that enchanting bliss, and it pained her.
But being unable to account for it all, she did the customary
thing for her&mdash;banished all these recollections
from her mind, and endeavored to obscure them by a life
of dissipation. At first she associated this man who sat
beside her with that young man whom she had loved
once, but as the thought pained her, she drove it from her
mind. And now this neatly dressed gentleman, with
perfumed beard, was to her not that Nekhludoff whom
she had loved, but one of those people who, as opportunity
afforded, were taking advantage of such creatures
as she, and of whom such creatures as she ought to take
advantage as opportunity offers. For this reason she
smiled alluringly.</p>

<p>She was silent, thinking how to profit by him.</p>

<p>"All that is over now," she said. "And here I am, sentenced
to penal servitude."</p>

<p>Her lips trembled as she spoke the terrible word.</p>

<p>"I knew, I was certain that you were innocent," said
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Of course I was innocent. I am no thief or robber.
They say here that it all depends on the lawyer; that it
is necessary to appeal. Only they say it comes very
high&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>"Yes, certainly," said Nekhludoff. "I have already
seen a lawyer."</p>

<p>"One must not be sparing, and get a good one," she
said.</p>

<p>"I will do everything in my power."</p>

<p>They were silent. She again smiled as before.</p>

<p>"I would like to ask you&mdash;for some money, if you have
it&mdash;not much, say ten rubles," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Nekhludoff, abashed, and thrust his
hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>She quickly glanced at the inspector, who was walking
up and down the aisle.</p>

<p>"Don't let him see it, or he will take it away."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff took out his pocketbook as soon as the
director turned his back on them, but before he could
hand her the ten-ruble bill the inspector turned round,
facing them. He crumpled the bill in his hand.</p>

<p>"Why, she is a dead woman," thought Nekhludoff as
he looked at her once lovely, but now defiled, bloated
face with the unhealthy sparkle in her black, squinting
eyes, which looked now at the inspector, now at Nekhludoff's
hand with the crumpled bill. And a moment of
hesitation came over him.</p>

<p>Again the tempter of the night before whispered in
his soul, endeavoring to turn the question, What would
be the best thing to do? into, What will be the end of it?</p>

<p>"You can do nothing with that woman," whispered
the voice. "She will be like a stone around your neck,
which will drag you down, and prevent your being useful
to others. Give her all the money you have, bid
her good-by and put an end to it for all time."</p>

<p>And immediately he became aware that something important
was taking place in his soul; that his inner life
was on a wavering scale, which could by the slightest
effort be made to overbalance to one side or the other.
And he made that effort, calling on that God whom the
other day he felt in his soul, and God immediately came
to his aid. He resolved to tell her all.</p>

<p>"Katiousha! I came to ask your forgiveness, but you
have not answered me whether you have forgiven me, or
ever will forgive me," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>She was not listening to him, but looked now at his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>hand, now at the inspector. When the latter turned
away, she quickly stretched forth her hand, seized the
money from Nekhludoff's hand and stuck it behind her
belt.</p>

<p>"How funny!" she said, smiling contemptuously as it
seemed to him.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff saw that there was something inimical to
him in her, which stood guard, as it were, over her as
she was now, and prevented him from penetrating into
her heart.</p>

<p>But&mdash;wonderful to relate&mdash;so far from repulsing him,
this only drew him to her by some new peculiar force.
He felt that he ought to awaken her spirit; that it was
extremely difficult to do so; but the very difficulty of the
undertaking attracted him. He experienced a feeling
toward her which he had never experienced before, either
toward her or any one else, and in which there was nothing
personal. He desired nothing of her for himself,
and only wished her to to cease to be what she was now,
and become what she had been before.</p>

<p>"Katiousha, why do you speak thus? I know you, I
remember you as you were in Panoff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she did not yield&mdash;she would not yield.</p>

<p>"Why recall the past!" she said dryly, frowning even
more.</p>

<p>"Because I wish to efface, to expiate my sin. Katiousha&mdash;&mdash;" he
began, and was about to tell her that
he would marry her, but he met her eyes in which he
read something so terrible, rude and <a name="repulsive" id="repulsive"></a>repulsive that he
could not finish.</p>

<p>At that moment the visitors began to take leave. The
inspector approached Nekhludoff and told him that the
time for interviewing was ended. Maslova rose and submissively
waited to be dismissed.</p>

<p>"Good-by. I have a great deal to tell you yet, but, as
you see, I cannot do it now," said Nekhludoff, and extended
his hand. "I will call again."</p>

<p>"I think you have said everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She extended her hand, but did not press his.</p>

<p>"No. I will try to see you again, where we can speak
together, and then I will tell you something very important,"
said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>"Well, all right," she said, smiling as she used to do
when she wished to please a man.</p>

<p>"You are more to me than a sister," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Funny," she repeated, and, shaking her head, she
went behind the grating.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>


<p><a name="Nekhul" id="Nekhul"></a>Nekhludoff expected that at the first meeting Katiousha,
learning of his intention to serve her, and of his repentance,
would be moved to rejoicing, would become
again Katiousha, but to his surprise and horror, he saw
that Katiousha was no more; that only Maslova remained.</p>

<p>It surprised him particularly that not only was Maslova
not ashamed of her condition, but, on the contrary, she
seemed to be content with, and even took pride in it. And
yet it could not be different.</p>

<p>It is usually thought that a thief or murderer, acknowledging
the harmfulness of his occupation, ought to be
ashamed of it. The truth is just the contrary. People,
whom fate and their sinful mistakes have placed in a
given condition, form such views of life generally that
they are enabled to consider their condition useful and
morally tenable. In order, however, to maintain such
views they instinctively cling to such circles in which the
same views are held. We are surprised when we hear
thieves boasting of their cleverness, or murderers boasting
of their cruelty, but that is only because their circle is
limited, and because we are outside of it.</p>

<p>This was the case also with Maslova. She was sentenced
to penal servitude, and yet she formed such views
of life and her place in it that she could find reasons for
self-approval and even boast before people of her condition.</p>

<p>The substance of this view was that the greatest welfare
of all men, without exception&mdash;young, old, students, generals,
educated and uneducated&mdash;consisted in associating
with attractive women, and that therefore all men, while
pretending to occupy themselves with other business, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>reality desire nothing else. Now, she is an attractive
woman, and can satisfy that desire of theirs, or not, as she
wishes, hence she is a necessary and important person.
All her life, past and present, attested the justice of this
view.</p>

<p>Whomever she met during ten years, beginning with
Nekhludoff and the old commissary of police, and ending
with the jailers, all wanted her. She had not met any one
who did not want her. Hence the world appeared to her
as an aggregation of people who watched her from all
sides and by all possible means&mdash;deceit, violence, gold or
craftiness&mdash;strewn to possess her.</p>

<p>With such an idea of life, Maslova considered herself
a most important person. And she cherished this view
above all else in the world, because to change it would be
to lose that standing among people which it assured her.
And in order not to lose her standing she instinctively
clung to that circle which held the same views of life.
Seeing, however, that Nekhludoff wished to lead her into
another world, she resisted it, feeling that in that other
world into which he was luring her she would lose her
present standing which gave her confidence and self-respect.
For the same reason she drove from her mind all
recollection of her first youth and her first relations to
Nekhludoff. These recollections clashed with her present
views of life, and for that reason were entirely effaced
from her memory, or, rather, were preserved somewhere
in her memory, but were covered up, as it were, with a
thick plastering, to prevent any access to them. Nekhludoff
was, therefore, to her not that man whom she had
loved with a pure love, but merely a rich gentleman by
whom one may and ought to profit, and who was to be
treated like any other man.</p>

<p>"I did not tell her the most important thing," thought
Nekhludoff, as with the other people he walked toward
the door. "I did not tell her that I would marry her, but
I will do it."</p>

<p>The inspectors at the doors counted the visitors each
with one hand slapping every visitor on the back. But
Nekhludoff was not offended by it now; he even took no
notice of it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>


<p>It was Nekhludoff's intention to alter his manner of living&mdash;discharge
the servants, let the house and take rooms
in a hotel. But Agrippina Petrovna argued that no one
would rent the house in the summer, and that as it was
necessary to live somewhere and keep the furniture and
things, he might as well remain where he was. So that all
efforts of Nekhludoff to lead a simple, student life, came
to naught. Not only was the old arrangement of things
continued, but, as in <a name="former" id="former"></a>former times, the house received a
general cleaning. First were brought out and hung on a
rope uniforms and strange fur garments which were never
used by anybody; then carpets, furniture, and the porter,
with his assistant, rolling up the sleeves on their muscular
arms, began to beat these things, and the odor of camphor
rose all over the house. Walking through the court-yard
and looking out of the window, Nekhludoff wondered
at the great number of unnecessary things kept in the
house. The only purpose these things served, he thought,
was to afford the servants an opportunity of exercise.</p>

<p>"It isn't worth while to alter my mode of life while Maslova's
affair is unsettled," he thought. "Besides, it is too
hard. When she is discharged or transported and I follow
her, things will change of their own accord."</p>

<p>On the day appointed by the lawyer Fanirin, Nekhludoff
called on him. On entering the magnificently appointed
apartments of the house owned by the lawyer himself,
with its huge plants, remarkable curtains and other
evidences of luxury, attesting easily earned wealth, Nekhludoff
found in the reception-room a number of people
sitting dejectedly around tables on which lay illustrated
journals intended for their diversion. The lawyer's clerk,
who was sitting in this room at a high desk, recognizing
Nekhludoff, greeted him and said that he would announce
him. But before the clerk reached the door of the cabinet,
the door opened and the animated voices of a thick-set
man with a red face and stubby mustache, wearing a
new suit, and Fanirin himself were heard. The expression
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>on their faces was such as is seen on people who had
just made a profitable, but not very honest, bargain.</p>

<p>"It is your own fault, my dear sir," Fanirin said, smiling.</p>

<p>"I would gladly go to heaven, but my sins prevent me."</p>

<p>"That is all right."</p>

<p>And both laughed unnaturally.</p>

<p>"Ah, Prince Nekhludoff! Pleased to see you," said
Fanirin, and bowing again to the departing merchant, he
led Nekhludoff into his business-like cabinet. "Please
take a cigarette," said the lawyer, seating himself opposite
Nekhludoff and suppressing a smile, called forth by the
success of the preceding affair.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I came to inquire about Maslova's case."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, immediately. My, what rogues these moneybags
are!" he said. "You have seen that fellow; he is
worth twelve millions, and is the meanest skinflint I ever
met."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff felt an irresistible loathing toward this
ready talker who, by his tone of voice, meant to show that
he and Nekhludoff belonged to a different sphere than the
other clients.</p>

<p>"He worried me to death. He is an awful rogue. I
wanted to ease my mind," said the lawyer, as if justifying
his not speaking about Nekhludoff's case. "And now as
to your case. I have carefully examined it, 'and could
not approve the contents thereof,' as Tourgeniff has it.
That is to say, the lawyer was a wretched one, and he let
slip all the grounds of appeal."</p>

<p>"What have you decided to do?"</p>

<p>"One moment. Tell him," he turned to his clerk, who
had just entered, "that I will not change my terms. He
can accept them or not, as he pleases."</p>

<p>"He does not accept them."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let him go," said the lawyer, and his benign
and joyful countenance suddenly assumed a gloomy
and angry expression.</p>

<p>"They say that lawyers take money for nothing," he
said, again assuming a pleasant expression. "I succeeded
in obtaining the discharge of an insolent debtor
who was incarcerated on flimsy accusations of fraud, and
now they all run after me. And every such case requires
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>great labor. We, too, you know, leave some of our flesh
in the ink-pot, as some author said."</p>

<p>"Well, now, your case, or rather the case in which you
are interested," he continued; "was badly conducted.
There are no good grounds for appeal, but, of course, we
can make an attempt. This is what I have written."</p>

<p>He took a sheet of paper, and quickly swallowing some
uninteresting, formal words, and emphasizing others, he
began to read:</p>

<p>"To the Department of Cassation, etc., etc., Katherine,
etc. Petition. By the decision, etc., of the etc., rendered,
etc., a certain Maslova was found guilty of taking the life,
by poisoning, of a certain merchant Smelkoff, and in pursuance
of <a name="Chapter_1454" id="Chapter_1454"></a>Chapter 1,454 of the Code, was sentenced to
etc., with hard labor, etc."</p>

<p>He stopped, evidently listening with pleasure to his own
composition, although from constant use he knew the
forms by heart.</p>

<p>"'This sentence is the result of grave errors,' he continued
with emphasis, 'and ought to be reversed for the
following reasons: First, the reading in the indictment
of the description of the entrails of Smelkoff was interrupted
by the justiciary at the very beginning.'&mdash;One."</p>

<p>"But the prosecutor demanded its reading," Nekhludoff
said with surprise.</p>

<p>"That is immaterial; the defense could have demanded
the same thing."</p>

<p>"But that was entirely unnecessary."</p>

<p>"No matter, it is a ground of appeal. Further: 'Second.
Maslova's attorney,' he continued to read, 'was interrupted
while addressing the jury, by the justiciary, when,
desiring to depict the character of Maslova, he touched
upon the inner causes of her fall. The ground for refusing
to permit him to continue his address was stated to be
irrelevancy to the question at issue. But as has often been
pointed out by the Senate, the character and moral features
generally of an accused are to be given the greatest
weight in determining the question of intent.'&mdash;Two."</p>

<p>"But he spoke so badly that we could not understand
him," said Nekhludoff with still greater surprise.</p>

<p>"He is a very foolish fellow and, of course, could say
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>nothing sensible," Fanirin said, laughing. "However, it
is a ground for appeal. 'Third. In his closing words the
justiciary, contrary to the positive requirements of section
1, chapter 801 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
failed to explain to the jury of what legal elements the
theory of guilt consisted; nor did he tell them that if they
found that Maslova gave the poison to Smelkoff, but without
intent to kill, they had the power to discharge her.'
This is the principal point."</p>

<p>"We could have known that. That was our mistake."</p>

<p>"And finally: 'Fourth,'" continued the lawyer.
"'The answer of the jury to the question of Maslova's
guilt was made in a form which was obviously contradictory.
Maslova was charged with intentional poisoning of
Smelkoff, and with robbery as a motive, while the jury, in
their answer, denied her guilt of the robbery, from which
it was evident that they intended to acquit her of the intent
to kill. Their failure to do so was due to the incomplete
charge of the justiciary. Such an answer, therefore, demanded
the application of chapters 816 and 808 of the
Code. That is to say, it was the duty of the presiding
justice to explain to the jury their mistake and refer the
question of the guilt of the accused to them for further
deliberation.'"</p>

<p>"Why, then, did he not do it?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I would like to know myself," said
Fanirin, laughing.</p>

<p>"So the Senate will correct the mistake."</p>

<p>"That will depend on who will be sitting there when
the case is heard."</p>

<p>"Well, and then we continue: 'Under these circumstances
the court erred in imposing on Maslova punishment,
and the application to her of section 3, chapter 771
of the Code was a serious violation of the basic principles
of the criminal law. Wherefore applicant demands, etc.,
etc., be revised in accordance with chs. 909, 910, s. 2, 912
and 928 of the Code, etc., etc., and referring the case back
for a new trial to a different part of the same court.'
Well, now, everything that could be done was done. But
I will be frank with you; the probabilities of success are
slight. However, everything depends on who will be sitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>in the Senate. If you know any one among them,
bestir yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know some."</p>

<p>"Then you must hasten, for they will soon be gone on
their vacation, and won't return for three months. In
case of failure, the only recourse will be to petition the
Czar. I shall be at your service also in that contingency."</p>

<p>"I thank you. And now as to your honorarium?"</p>

<p>"My clerk will hand you the petition and also my bill."</p>

<p>"One more question I would like to ask you. The
prosecutor gave me a pass for the prison, but I was told
there that it was necessary to obtain the Governor's permission
to visit the prison on other than visitors' days. Is
it necessary?"</p>

<p>"I think so. But he is away, and the lieutenant is in
his place."</p>

<p>"You mean Maslenikoff?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I know him," said Nekhludoff, rising to leave.</p>

<p>At that moment the lawyer's wife, an extremely ugly,
pug-nosed and bony woman, rushed into the room. Not
only was her attire unusually original&mdash;she was fairly
loaded down with plush and silk things, bright yellow and
green&mdash;but her oily hair was done up in curls, and she
triumphantly rushed into the reception-room, accompanied
by a tall, smiling man with an earth-colored face, in a cut-away
coat with silk facings and a white tie. This was an
author. He knew Nekhludoff by sight.</p>

<p>"Anatal," she said, opening the door, "come here.
Semion Ivanovitch promised to read to us his poem, and
you must read something from Garshin."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff was preparing to go, but the lawyer's wife
whispered something to her husband and turned to him:</p>

<p>"I know you, Prince, and consider an introduction unnecessary.
Won't you please attend our literary breakfast?
It will be very interesting. Anatal is an excellent
reader."</p>

<p>"You see what variety of duties I have," said Anatal,
smiling and pointing at his wife, thereby expressing the
impossibility of resisting that bewitching person.</p>

<p>With a sad and grave face and with the greatest politeness,
Nekhludoff thanked the lawyer's wife for the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>invitation,
pleaded other engagements and went into the reception-room.</p>

<p>"What faces he makes!" the lawyer's wife said of him,
when he had left the room.</p>

<p>In the reception-room the clerk handed him the petition,
and in answer to Nekhludoff's question about the honorarium,
said that Anatal Semionovitch set his fee at a
thousand rubles; that he really does not take such cases,
but does it for Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"And who is to sign the petition?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"The prisoner may sign it herself, and if that be troublesome,
she may empower Anatal Semionovitch."</p>

<p>"No, I will go to the prison and obtain her signature,"
said Nekhludoff, rejoicing at the opportunity of seeing
Katiousha before the appointed day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV"></a>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>


<p>At the usual hour the jailers' whistles were heard in the
corridors of the prison; with a rattling of irons the doors
of the corridors and cells opened, and the patter of bare
feet and the clatter of prison shoes resounded through the
corridors; the men and women prisoners washed and
dressed, and after going through the morning inspection,
proceeded to brew their tea.</p>

<p>During the tea-drinking animated conversations were
going on among the prisoners in the cells and corridors.
Two prisoners were to be flogged that day. One of these
was a fairly intelligent young clerk who, in a fit of jealousy,
had killed his mistress. He was loved by his fellow-prisoners
for his cheerfulness, liberality and firmness in
dealing with the authorities. He knew the laws and demanded
compliance with them. Three weeks ago the
warden struck one of the chambermen for spilling some
soup on his new uniform. The clerk, Vasilieff, took the
chamberman's part, saying that there was no law permitting
an official to beat prisoners. "I will show you the
law," said the warden, reviling Vasilieff. The latter answered
in kind. The warden was about to strike him, but
Vasilieff caught hold of his hands and held him fast for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>about three minutes and then pushed him out of the door.
The warden complained and the inspector ordered Vasilieff
placed in solitary confinement.</p>

<p>These cells for solitary confinement were dark closets
iron-bolted from the outside. In these cold, damp cells, devoid
of bed, table or chair, the prisoners were obliged to
sit or lie on the dirty floor. The rats, of which there was
a large number, crawled all over them, and were so bold
that they devoured the prisoner's bread and often attacked
the prisoners themselves when they remained motionless.
Vasilieff resisted, and with the aid of two other prisoners,
tore himself loose from the jailers, but they were finally
overcome and all three were thrust into cells. It was reported
to the Governor that something like a mutiny occurred,
and in answer came a document ordering that the
two chief culprits, Vasilieff and the tramp Don'tremember
(an application given to some tramps and jail birds who,
to conceal the identity, with characteristic ingenuity and
stupidity make that answer to all questions relating to
their names), be given thirty lashes each.</p>

<p>The flogging was to take place in the women's reception-room.</p>

<p>This was known to all the inmates of the prison since
the previous evening, and every one was talking of the
coming flogging.</p>

<p>Korableva, Miss Dandy, Theodosia and Maslova,
flushed and animated, for they had already partaken of
<a name="vodka" id="vodka"></a>vodka which Maslova now had in abundance, were sitting
in their corner, talking of the same thing.</p>

<p>"Why, he has not misbehaved," Korableva said of Vasilieff,
biting off a piece of sugar with her strong teeth.
"He only sided with a comrade. Fighting, you know, is
not allowed nowadays."</p>

<p>"They say he is a fine fellow," added Theodosia, who
was sitting on a log on which stood a tea-pot.</p>

<p>"If you were to tell him, Michaelovna," the watch-woman
said to Maslova, meaning Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I will. He will do anything for me," Maslova answered,
smiling and shaking her head.</p>

<p>"It will be too late; they are going to fetch him now,"
said Theodosia. "It is awful," she added, sighing.</p>

<p>"I have seen once a peasant flogged in the town hall.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>My father-in-law had sent me to the Mayor of the borough,
and when I came there I was surprised to see him&mdash;&mdash;"
The watch-woman began a long story.</p>

<p>Her story was interrupted by voices and steps on the
upper corridor.</p>

<p>The women became silent, listening.</p>

<p>"They are bringing him, the fiends," said Miss Dandy.
"Won't he get it now! The jailers are very angry, for he
gave them no rest."</p>

<p>It became quiet in the upper corridor, and the watch-woman
finished her story, how she was frightened when
she saw the peasant flogged, and how it turned her stomach.
Miss Dandy told how Schezloff was flogged with a
lash while he never uttered a word. Theodosia then removed
the pots and bowls; Korableva and the watch-woman
took to their sewing, while Maslova, hugging
her knees, became sad from ennui. She was about to lay
down to sleep when the matron called her into the office,
where a visitor was waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Don't fail to tell him about us," said the old Menshova,
while Maslova was arranging her headgear before a looking-glass
half void of mercury. "It was not me who set
the fire, but he, the villain, himself did it, and the laborer
saw it. He would not kill a man. Tell him to call Dmitry.
Dmitry will explain to him everything. They
locked us up here for nothing, while the villain is living
with another man's wife and sits around in dram-shops."</p>

<p>"That's wrong!" affirmed Korableva.</p>

<p>"I will tell him&mdash;yes, I will," answered Maslova. "Suppose
we have a drink, for courage?" she added, winking
one eye.</p>

<p>Korableva poured out half a cup for her. Maslova
drank it and wiped her mouth. Her spirits rose, and repeating
the words "for courage," shaking her head and
smiling, she followed the matron.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV"></a>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff had been waiting for a long time in the
vestibule.</p>

<p>Arriving at the prison he rang the front-door bell and
handed his pass to the warden on duty.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see the prisoner Maslova."</p>

<p>"Can't see her now; the inspector is busy."</p>

<p>"In the office?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"No, here in the visitors' room," the warden answered,
somewhat embarrassed, as it seemed to Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Why, are visitors admitted to-day?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;special business," he answered.</p>

<p>"Where can I see him, then?"</p>

<p>"He will come out presently. Wait."</p>

<p>At that moment a sergeant-major in bright crown-laced
uniform, his face radiant, and his mustache impregnated
with smoke, appeared from a side door.</p>

<p>"Why did you admit him here? What is the office
for?" he said sternly, turning to the warden.</p>

<p>"I was told that the inspector was here," said Nekhludoff,
surprised at the embarrassment noticeable on the officer's
face.</p>

<p>At that moment the inner door opened and Petroff,
flushed and perspiring, came out.</p>

<p>"He will remember it," he said, turning to the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>The latter pointed with his eyes to Nekhludoff, and
Petroff became silent, frowned and walked out through
the rear door.</p>

<p>"Who will remember? What? Why are they all so
embarrassed? Why did the sergeant make that sign?"
thought Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"You cannot wait here; please walk into the office," the
sergeant-major turned to Nekhludoff, who was about to
go out when the inspector came in through the inner door,
more embarrassed even than his assistants. He was sighing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>incessantly. Seeing Nekhludoff, he turned to the warden:</p>

<p>"Fedotoff, call Maslova."</p>

<p>"Follow me, please," he said to Nekhludoff. They
passed up a winding stairway leading into a small room
with one window and containing a writing table and a
few chairs. The inspector sat down.</p>

<p>"Mine are disagreeable duties," he said, turning to
Nekhludoff and lighting a thick cigarette.</p>

<p>"You seem tired," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I am very tired of all this business; my duties are very
onerous. I am trying my best to alleviate the condition
of the prisoners and things are getting only worse. I am
very anxious to get away from here; the duties are very,
very unpleasant."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff could not understand what it was that made
it so unpleasant for the inspector, but to-day he noticed
on the inspector's face an expression of despondency and
hopelessness which was pitiful to behold.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they are very trying," he said. "But why
do you not resign?"</p>

<p>"I have a family and am without means."</p>

<p>"But if it is difficult&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I manage to improve somewhat their lot
after all. Another one in my place would hardly exert
himself as I do. It is no easy matter to handle two thousand
people. They are also human and one feels pity for
them, and yet they can't be allowed to have all their own
way."</p>

<p>And the inspector related the case of a recent fight
among the prisoners which ended in murder.</p>

<p>His story was interrupted by the entrance of Maslova,
who was preceded by the warden.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff got sight of her when she appeared on the
threshold and before she saw the inspector. Her face
was red, and she walked briskly behind the warden, smiling
and shaking her head. Noticing the inspector she
gazed at him with frightened face, but immediately recovered
herself and boldly and cheerfully turned to Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said, drawlingly, smiling and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>vigorously shaking his hand, not as on the former occasion.</p>

<p>"Here I have brought you the petition to sign," said
Nekhludoff, somewhat surprised at the forward manner
in which she accosted him. "The lawyer wrote it. It
must be signed and sent to St. Petersburg."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. I will do anything," she said, winking
one eye and smiling.</p>

<p>"May she sign it here?" Nekhludoff asked of the inspector.</p>

<p>"Come here and sit down," said the inspector. "Here
is a pen for you. Can you write?"</p>

<p>"I could write once," she said, smiling, and, arranging
her skirt and waist-sleeve, sat down, clumsily took
the pen into her small, energetic hand, began to laugh
and looked round at Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>He pointed out to her where to sign.</p>

<p>Diligently dipping and shaking the pen she signed her
name.</p>

<p>"Do you wish anything else?" she asked, looking now
at Nekhludoff, now at the inspector, and depositing the
pen now on the ink-stand, now on the paper.</p>

<p>"I wish to tell you something," said Nekhludoff, taking
the pen from her hand.</p>

<p>"Very well; go on," she uttered, and suddenly, as
though meditating or growing sleepy, her face became
grave.</p>

<p>The inspector rose and walked out, leaving Nekhludoff
with her alone.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>


<p>The warden who brought Maslova to the office seated
himself on the window-sill, away from the table. This
was a decisive moment for Nekhludoff. He had been
constantly reproaching himself for not telling her at their
first meeting of his intention to marry her, and was now
determined to do so. She was sitting on one side of the
table, and Nekhludoff seated himself on the other side,
opposite her. The room was well lighted, and for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>first time Nekhludoff clearly saw her face from a short
distance, and noticed wrinkles around the eyes and lips
and a slight swelling under her eyes, and he pitied her
even more than before.</p>

<p>Resting his elbows on the table so that he should not
be heard by the warden, whose face was of a Jewish type,
with grayish side-whiskers, he said:</p>

<p>"If this petition fails we will appeal to His Majesty.
Nothing will be left undone."</p>

<p>"If it had been done before&mdash;if I had had a good lawyer"&mdash;she
interrupted him. "That lawyer of mine was
such a little fool. He was only making me compliments,"
she said, and began to laugh. "If they had only known
that I was your acquaintance, it would have been different.
They think that everybody is a thief."</p>

<p>"How strange she is to-day," thought Nekhludoff, and
was about to tell her what he had on his mind when she
again began to speak.</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you. There is an old woman here&mdash;we
are even surprised&mdash;such a good little woman, but
there she is&mdash;she and her son, both in prison, and everybody
knows that they are innocent. They are accused of
setting fire, so they are in prison. She learned, you know,
that I am acquainted with you," said Maslova, turning
her head and casting glances at him, "and she says to me:
'Tell him,' she says, 'to call my son; he will tell him the
whole story.' Menshoff is his name. Well, will you do
it? Such a good little woman. You can see for yourself
that she is not guilty. You will help them, dear, won't
you?" she said, glancing at him; then she lowered her
eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>"Very well; I will do it," said Nekhludoff, his surprise
at her easy manner growing, "but I would like to talk to
you about my own affair. Do you remember what I told
you that time?"</p>

<p>"You have spoken so much. What did you say that
time?" she said, continuing to smile and turning her head
now to one side, now to the other.</p>

<p>"I said that I came to ask your forgiveness," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! Forgiveness, forgiveness! That is all nonsense.
You had better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I wish to atone for my sin," continued Nekhludoff,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>"and to atone not by words but by deed. I have
decided to marry you."</p>

<p>Her face suddenly showed fright. Her squinting eyes
became fixed, and they looked and did not look at him.</p>

<p>"What is that for?" And she frowned maliciously.</p>

<p>"I feel that before God I must do it."</p>

<p>"What God, now, are you talking about? You are not
talking to the point. God? What God? Why didn't
you think of God then?" she said, and opening her mouth,
stopped short.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff only now smelled a strong odor of liquor
and understood the cause of her excitement.</p>

<p>"Be calm," he said.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to be calm about. You think I am
drunk? Yes, I am drunk, but I know what I am talking
about," she said quickly, and her face became purple. "I
am a convict, while you are a lord, a prince, and needn't
stay here to soil your hands. Go to your princesses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You cannot be too cruel to me; you do not know how
I feel," he said in a low voice, his whole body trembling.
"You cannot imagine how strongly I feel my guilt before
you!"</p>

<p>"Feel my guilt," she mocked him maliciously. "You
did not feel it then, but thrust a hundred rubles in my
hands. 'That's your price&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I know, I know, but what am I to do now? I have
decided not to leave you," he repeated; "and what I say
I will do."</p>

<p>"And I say that you will not!" she said, and laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>"Katinsha!" he began.</p>

<p>"Leave me. I am a convict, and you are a prince; and
you have no business here," she shrieked, violently releasing
her hand from his, her wrath knowing no limit.</p>

<p>"You wish to save yourself through me," she continued,
hastening to pour out all that had accumulated in her soul.
"You have made me the means of your enjoyment in life,
and now you wish to make me the means of saving you
after death! You disgust me, as do your eye-glasses and
that fat, dirty face of yours. Go, go away!" she shrieked,
energetically springing to her feet.</p>

<p>The warden approached them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>"Don't you make so much noise! You know whom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please desist," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"She must not forget herself," said the warden.</p>

<p>"Please wait a while," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>The warden returned to his seat on the window-sill.</p>

<p>Maslova again seated herself, her eyes downcast and
her little hands clutching each other.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff stood over her, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>"You do not believe me," he said.</p>

<p>"That you wish to marry me? That will never happen.
I will sooner hang myself."</p>

<p>"But I will serve you anyway."</p>

<p>"That is your business. Only I don't want anything
from you. Now, that is certain," she said. "Oh, why
did I not die then!" she added, and began to cry piteously.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff could not speak; her tears called forth tears
in his own eyes.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, looked at him, as if surprised, and
with her 'kerchief began to wipe the tears streaming down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>The warden again approached them and reminded them
that it was time to part. Maslova rose.</p>

<p>"You are excited now. If possible I will call to-morrow.
Meantime, think it over," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>She made no answer, and without looking at him left
the room, preceded by the warden.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Well, girl, good times are coming," said <a name="Korableva" id="Korableva"></a>Korableva to
Maslova when the latter returned to the cell. "He seems
to be stuck on you, so make the most of it while he is
calling. He will get you released. The rich can do anything."</p>

<p>"That's so," drawled the watch-woman. "The poor man
will think ten times before he will marry, while the rich
man can satisfy his every whim. Yes, my dear; there
was a respectable man in our village, and he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to him of my case?" asked the old
woman.</p>

<p>But Maslova was silent. She lay down on her bunk,
gazing with her squinting eyes into the corner, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>remained
in that position till evening. Her soul was in
torment. That which Nekhludoff told her opened to her
that world in which she had suffered and which she had
left, hating without understanding it. She had now lost
that forgetfulness in which she had lived, and to live with
a clear recollection of the past was painful. In the evening
she again bought wine, which she drank with her
fellow-prisoners.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII"></a>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>


<p>"So, that is how it is!" thought Nekhludoff as he made
his way out of the prison, and he only now realized the
extent of his guilt. Had he not attempted to efface and
atone for his conduct, he should never have felt all the
infamy of it, nor she all the wrong perpetrated against
her. Only now it all came out in all its horror. He now
for the first time perceived how her soul had been debased,
and she finally understood it. At first Nekhludoff had
played with his feelings and delighted in his own contrition;
now he was simply horrified. He now felt that to
abandon her was impossible. And yet he could not see
the result of these relations.</p>

<p>At the prison gate some one handed Nekhludoff a note.
He read it when on the street. The note was written
in a bold hand, with pencil, and contained the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Having learned that you are visiting the prison I
thought it would be well to see you. You can see me by
asking the authorities for an interview with me. I will
tell you something very important to your protege as well
as to the politicals. Thankfully, Vera Bogodukhovskaia"</p></div>

<p>"Bogodukhovskaia! Who is Bogodukhovskaia?"
thought Nekhludoff, entirely absorbed in the impression
of his meeting with Maslova, and failing at the first moment
to recall either the name or the handwriting. "Oh,
yes!" he suddenly recalled. "The deacon's daughter at
the bear-hunt."</p>

<p>Vera Bogodukhovskaia was a teacher in the obscure
district of Novgorod, whither Nekhludoff, on one occasion,
went bear hunting with his friends. This teacher
had asked Nekhludoff to give her some money to enable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>her to study. He gave it to her, and the incident dropped
from his memory. And now it seemed that this lady was
a political prisoner, had probably learned his history in
prison, and was now offering her services. At that time
everything was easy and simple; now everything was difficult
and complex. Nekhludoff readily and joyfully recalled
that time and his acquaintance with Bogodukhovskaia.
It was on the eve of Shrovetide, in the wilds
about sixty versts from the railroad. The hunt was successful;
two bears were bagged, and they were dining
before their journey home, when the woodsman, in whose
hut they were stopping, came to tell them that the deacon's
daughter had come and wished to see Prince Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Is she good looking?" some one asked.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" said Nekhludoff, rising, and wondering
why the deacon's daughter should want him, assumed a
grave expression and went to the woodsman's hut.</p>

<p>In the hut there was a girl in a felt hat and short fur
coat, sinewy, and with an ugly and unpleasant face, relieved,
however, by her pleasant eyes and raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>"This is the Prince, Vera Efremovna," said the old
hostess. "I will leave you."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;You see, you are rich and throw away your
money on trifles, on a chase. I know," began the girl, becoming
confused, "but I wish but one thing; I wish to
be useful to people, and can do nothing because I know
nothing."</p>

<p>"What, then, can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I am a teacher, and would like to enter college, but
they don't let me. It is not exactly that they don't let me,
but we have no means. Let me have some money; when
I am through with my studies I shall return it to you."</p>

<p>Her eyes were truthful and kindly, and the expression
of resolution and timidity on her face was so touching
that Nekhludoff, as it was usual with him, suddenly mentally
placed himself in her position, understood and pitied
her.</p>

<p>"I think it is wrong for rich people to kill bears and
get the peasants drunk. Why don't they make themselves
useful? I only need eighty rubles. Oh, if you don't wish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>to, it is all the same to me," she said, angrily, interpreting
the grave expression on Nekhludoff's face to her disadvantage.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am very thankful to you for the
opportunity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>When she understood that he consented her face turned
a purple color and she became silent.</p>

<p>"I will fetch it immediately," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>He went into the entrance hall where he found an
eavesdropping friend. Without taking notice of his comrade's
jests, he took the money from his hand-bag and
brought it to her.</p>

<p>"Please don't be thanking me. It is I who ought to be
thankful to you."</p>

<p>It was pleasant to Nekhludoff to recall all that; it was
pleasant to recall how he came near quarreling with the
army officer who attempted to make a bad joke of it; how
another comrade sided with him, which drew them more
closely together; how merry and successful was the hunt,
and how happy he felt that night returning to the railroad
station. A long file of sleighs moved noiselessly in pairs
at a gentle trot along the narrow fir-lined path of the
forests, which were covered with a heavy layer of snowflakes.
Some one struck a red light in the dark, and the
pleasant aroma of a good cigarette was wafted toward
him. Osip, the sleigh-tender, ran from sleigh to sleigh,
knee-deep in snow, telling of the elks that were roaming
in the deep snow, nibbling the bark of aspen trees, and
of the bears emitting their warm breath through the airholes
of their wild haunts.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff remembered all that, and above all the
happy consciousness of his own health, strength and freedom
from care. His lungs, straining his tight-fitting fur
coat, inhaled the frosty air; the trees, grazed by the shaft,
sent showers of white flakes into his face; his body was
warm, his face ruddy; his soul was without a care or
blemish, or fear or desire. How happy he was! But
now? My God! How painful and unbearable it all was!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>


<p>Rising the next morning Nekhludoff recalled the events
of the previous day and was seized with fear.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this fear, he was even more determined
than before to carry out his plan already begun.</p>

<p>With this consciousness of the duty that lay upon him
he drove to Maslenikoff for permission to visit in jail,
besides Maslova, the old woman Menshova and her son,
of whom Maslova had spoken to him. Besides, he also
wished to see Bogodukhovskaia, who might be useful to
Maslova.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff had known Maslenikoff since they together
served in the army. Maslenikoff was the treasurer of the
regiment. He was the most kind-hearted officer, and
possessed executive ability. Nothing in society was of
any interest to him, and he was entirely absorbed in the
affairs of the regiment. Nekhludoff now found him an
administrator in the civil government. He was married
to a rich and energetic woman to whom was due his
change of occupation.</p>

<p>She laughed at him and patted him as she would a
tamed animal. Nekhludoff had visited them once the
previous winter, but the couple seemed so uninteresting to
him that he never called again.</p>

<p>Maslenikoff's face became radiant when he saw Nekhludoff.
His face was as fat and red, his dress as excellent
as when he served in the army. As an army officer he
was always neat, dressed in a tight uniform made according
to the latest style; now his dress fitted his well-fed
body as perfectly. He wore a uniform. Notwithstanding
the difference in their age&mdash;Maslenikoff was about
forty&mdash;they familiarly "thoued" each other.</p>

<p>"Very glad you remembered me. Come to my wife.
I have just ten minutes to spare, and then I must to the
session. My chief, you know, is away. I am directing
the affairs of the district," he said, with joy which he
could not conceal.</p>

<p>"I came to you on business."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>"What's that?" Maslenikoff said in a frightened and
somewhat stern voice, suddenly pricking his ears.</p>

<p>"There is a person in jail in whom I am very much interested;"
at the word "jail" Maslenikoff's face became
even more stern, "and I would like to have the right of
interview in the office instead of the common reception
room, and oftener than on the appointed days. I was told
that it depended on you."</p>

<p>"Of course, mon cher, I am always ready to do anything
for you," Maslenikoff said, touching his knees with
both hands, as if desiring to soften his own greatness. "I
can do it, but you know I am caliph only for an hour."</p>

<p>"So you can give me a pass that will enable me to see
her?"</p>

<p>"It is a woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is the charge against her?"</p>

<p>"Poisoning. But she was irregularly convicted."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is justice for you! Ils n'en font point
d'autres," he said, for some reason in French. "I know
that you do not agree with me, but c'est mon opinion bien
arretee," he added, repeating the opinion that had been
reiterated during the past year by a retrograde, conservative
newspaper. "I know you are a liberal."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I am a liberal or something
else," smilingly said Nekhludoff, who always wondered at
being joined to some party, or called a liberal only because
he held that a man must not be judged without
being heard; that all are equal before the law; that it
is wrong to torture and beat people generally, especially
those that are not convicted. "I don't know whether I
am a liberal or not, but I do know that our present courts,
bad as they are, are nevertheless better than those that
preceded them."</p>

<p>"And what lawyer have you retained?"</p>

<p>"I have retained Fanarin."</p>

<p>"Ah, Fanarin!" Maslenikoff said, frowning as he recalled
how Fanarin, examining him as a witness the year
before, in the most polite manner made him the butt of
ridicule.</p>

<p>"I would not advise you to have anything to do with
him. Fanarin est un homme tare."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>"I have another request to make of you," Nekhludoff
said, without answering him. "A long time ago I made
the acquaintance of a girl teacher, a very wretched creature.
She is now in jail and desires to see me. Can you
give me a pass to her?"</p>

<p>Maslenikoff leaned his head to one side and began to
reflect.</p>

<p>"She is a political."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was told so."</p>

<p>"You know politicals can only be seen by their relatives,
but I will give you a general pass. Je sais que vous
n'abuserez pas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is the name of this your protege? Bogodukhovskaia?
Elle est jolie?"</p>

<p>"Hideuse."</p>

<p>Maslenikoff disapprovingly shook his head, went to
the table and on a sheet of paper with a printed letter-head
wrote in a bold hand: "The bearer, Prince Dmitri
Ivanovich Nekhludoff, is hereby permitted to visit the
prisoners, Maslova and Bogodukhovskaia, now detained
in the prison," and signed his name to it with a broad
flourish.</p>

<p>"You will see now what order there is in prison. And
to keep order there is very difficult, because it is overcrowded,
especially by those to be transported. But I
watch over them, and like the occupation. You will see
there are very many there, but they are content, and are
faring well. It is necessary to know how to deal with
them. Some unpleasantness occurred there a few days
ago&mdash;disobedience. Another man in my place would have
treated it as a riot and made many people miserable, but
we arranged it all pleasantly. What is necessary is solicitude
on the one hand, and prompt and vigorous dealing
on the other," he said, clenching his soft, white fist projecting
from under a white, starched cuff and adorned
with a turquoise ring&mdash;"solicitude and vigorous dealing."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about that," said Nekhludoff. "I
was there twice, and I was very much distressed by the
sight."</p>

<p>"You know what I will tell you? You ought to get
acquainted with Princess Passek," continued Maslenikoff,
who had become talkative; "she has entirely devoted <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>herself
to this cause. Elle fait beaucoup de bien. Thanks
to her and, without false modesty, to myself, everything
has been changed, and changed so that none of the old
horrors can be found there, and they are decidedly well
off there. You will see it. There is Fanarin. I am not
personally acquainted with him; besides, our roads do not
meet because of my position in society, but he is decidedly
a bad man, and allows himself to state in court such
things, such things!"</p>

<p>"Well, thank you," said Nekhludoff, taking the document,
and took leave of his old comrade.</p>

<p>"Would you not like to see my wife?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you; I have no time now."</p>

<p>"Well, now, she will never forgive me," said Maslenikoff,
conducting his old comrade to the first landing, as
he did with people of secondary importance, among whom
he reckoned Nekhludoff. "Do come but for a moment."</p>

<p>But Nekhludoff was firm, and while the footman and
porter sprang toward him, handing him his overcoat and
cane, and opening the door, before which a policeman
stood, he excused himself, pleading want of time.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Thursday, please. That is her reception
day. I will tell her!" Maslenikoff shouted from the top
of the stairs.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX"></a>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>


<p>From Maslenikoff, Nekhludoff went directly to the
prison and approached the familiar apartments of the inspector.
The sounds of a tuneless piano again assailed
his ears, but this time it was not a rhapsody that was
played, but a study by Clementi, and, as before, with unusual
force, precision and rapidity. The servant with a
handkerchief around one eye said that the captain was in,
and showed Nekhludoff into the small reception-room, in
which was a lounge, a table and a lamp, one side of the
rose-colored shade of which was scorched, standing on a
knitted woolen napkin. The inspector appeared with an
expression of sadness and torment on his face.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you. What can I do for you?" he said,
buttoning up the middle button of his uniform.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>"I went to the vice-governor, and here is my pass," said
Nekhludoff, handing him the document. "I would like
to see Maslova."</p>

<p>"Markova?" asked the inspector, who could not hear
him on account of the music.</p>

<p>"Maslova."</p>

<p>"O, yes! O, yes!"</p>

<p>The inspector rose and approached the door through
which Clementi's roulade was heard.</p>

<p>"Marusia; if you would only stop for a little while,"
he said in a voice which showed that this music was the
cross of his life; "I cannot hear anything."</p>

<p>The music ceased; discontented steps were heard, and
some one looked through the door.</p>

<p>The inspector, as if relieved by the cessation of the
music, lit a thick cigarette of light tobacco and offered one
to Nekhludoff, which he refused.</p>

<p>"Can Maslova&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not convenient to see Maslova to-day," said the
inspector.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It is your own fault," slightly smiling, said the inspector.
"Prince, you must not give her any money. If
you wish to give her money, leave it with me; I will keep
it for her. You see, you must have given her money
yesterday, for she bought wine&mdash;it is hard to eradicate
that evil&mdash;and is intoxicated to-day. In fact, she became
unruly."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Why, I even had to employ strict measures, had her
transferred to another cell. She is very tractable, but,
please do not give her money. That is their failing."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff quickly recalled the incident of yesterday,
and he was seized with fear.</p>

<p>"And may I see Bogodukhovskaia, the political?"
Nekhludoff asked, after some silence.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said the inspector. "What are you doing
here?" he turned to a five-year-old girl who came into the
room, walking toward her father, her eyes riveted on
Nekhludoff. "Look out, or you will fall," he said, smiling,
as the little girl, walking with her head turned <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>toward
Nekhludoff, tripped on the carpet and ran to her
father.</p>

<p>"If she may be seen, I would go now."</p>

<p>"Oh yes; she may be seen, of course," said the inspector,
embracing the little girl, who was still looking at Nekhludoff.
"All right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector rose and gently turning the girl aside,
walked into the vestibule.</p>

<p>He had scarcely donned the overcoat handed him by
the girl with the bandaged eye and crossed the threshold
when the distinct sounds of Clementi's roulade broke
out.</p>

<p>"She was at the Conservatory, but there is disorder
in that institution. But she is very gifted," said the inspector,
walking down the stairs. "She intends to appear
at concerts."</p>

<p>The inspector and Nekhludoff neared the prison. The
wicket immediately opened at the approach of the inspector.
The wardens standing to attention followed him
with their eyes. Four men with heads half shaved, carrying
large vessels, met him in the vestibule, and as they
spied him slunk back. One of them, in a particularly
gloomy way, knit his brow, his black eyes flashing fire.</p>

<p>"Of course, her talent must be perfected; it cannot be
neglected. But in a small apartment it is hard, you
know," the inspector continued the conversation without
paying any attention to the prisoners, and dragging his
tired legs passed into the meeting-room, followed by
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Whom do you wish to see?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"Bogodukhovskaia."</p>

<p>"That is from the tower. You will have to wait a
little," he turned to Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you let me see, meantime, the prisoners Menshov&mdash;mother
and son&mdash;who are charged with incendiarism?"</p>

<p>"That is from cell 21. Why, yes; they may be called
out."</p>

<p>"Would you allow me to see the son in his cell?"</p>

<p>"It is quieter in the meeting-room."</p>

<p>"But it is interesting to see him there."</p>

<p>"Interesting!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>At that moment a dashing officer, the inspector's assistant,
appeared at a side door.</p>

<p>"Conduct the Prince to Menshov's cell&mdash;No. 21," said
the inspector to his assistant. "Then show him to the
office. And I will call&mdash;what is her name?"</p>

<p>"Vera Bogodukhovskaia," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>The inspector's assistant was a light-haired young officer
with dyed mustache, who spread around him the odor
of perfume.</p>

<p>"Follow me, please." He turned to Nekhludoff with
a pleasant smile. "Does our institution interest you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I am also interested in that man who, I
was told, is innocent." The assistant shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes, that may be," he said calmly, courteously admitting
the guest into the ill-smelling corridor. "But
they also lie often. Walk in, please."</p>

<p>The doors of the cells were open, and some prisoners
stood in the corridor. Slightly nodding to the wardens
and looking askance at the prisoners, who either pressed
against the walls, entered their cells, or, stopping at the
doors, stood erect like soldiers, the assistant escorted
Nekhludoff through one corridor into another, on the
left, which was iron-bolted.</p>

<p>This corridor was darker and more ill-smelling than
the first. There was a row of cells on each side, the
doors of which were locked. There was a hole in each
door&mdash;eyelet, so called&mdash;of about an inch in diameter.
There was no one in this corridor except an old warden
with a wrinkled, sad face.</p>

<p>"Where is Menshov's cell?" asked the assistant.</p>

<p>"The eighth one on the left."</p>

<p>"Are these occupied?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"All but one."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L"></a>CHAPTER L.</h2>


<p>"May I look in?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"If you please," the assistant said with a pleasant smile,
and began to make inquiries of the warden. Nekhludoff
looked through one of the openings. A tall young man
with a small black beard, clad only in his linen, walked
rapidly up and down the floor of his cell. Hearing a
rustle at the door, he looked up, frowned, and continued
to walk.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff looked into the second opening. His eye
met another large, frightened eye. He hastily moved
away. Looking into the third, he saw a small-sized man
sleeping curled up on a cot, his head covered with his
prison coat. In the fourth cell a broad-faced, pale-looking
man sat with lowered head, his elbows resting on his
knees. Hearing steps, this man raised his head and looked
up. In his face and eyes was an expression of hopeless
anguish. He was apparently unconcerned about who it
was that looked into his cell. Whoever it might be, he
evidently hoped for no good from any one. Nekhludoff
was seized with fear, and he hastened to Number 21&mdash;Menshov's
cell. The warden unlocked and opened the
door. A young, muscular man with a long neck, kindly,
round eyes and small beard, stood beside his cot, hastily
donning his prison coat and, with frightened face, looking
at the two men who had entered. Nekhludoff was particularly
struck by the kindly, round eyes whose wondering
and startled look ran from him to the warden and
back.</p>

<p>"This gentleman wishes to ask you about your case."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was told about your case," said Nekhludoff,
going into the depth of the cell and stopping at the barred,
dirty window, "and would like to hear it from yourself."</p>

<p>Menshov also drew near the window and immediately
began to relate the particulars of his case&mdash;at first timidly,
from time to time glancing at the warden, then growing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>bolder and bolder. And when the warden had left the
cell to give some orders, his timidity left him entirely.
Judging by his speech and manner, his was a story of
a simple, honest peasant, and it seemed very strange to
Nekhludoff to hear it from the lips of a prisoner in the
garb of disgrace and in prison. While listening to him,
Nekhludoff examined the low cot, with its straw mattress,
the window, with its thick iron bars, the damp, plastered
walls, the pitiful face and the figure of the unfortunate,
mutilated peasant in bast shoes and prison coat, and he
became sad; he would not believe that what this kind-hearted
man told him was true. And it was still harder
to think that this truthful story should be false, and that
kindly face should deceive him. His story, in short, was
that soon after his wedding a tapster enticed away his
wife. He had recourse to the law everywhere, and the
tapster was everywhere acquitted. Once he took her away
by force, but she ran away the following day. He went
to the seducer, demanding his wife. The tapster told him
that she was not there, although he saw her when coming
in, and ordered him to depart. He would not go. Then
the tapster and another workman beat him until he bled,
and the following day the tapster's house took fire. He
and his mother were charged with incendiarism, although
at the time the fire broke out he was visiting a friend.</p>

<p>"And you really did not set the fire?"</p>

<p>"I never even thought of such a thing, master. The
villain must have done it himself. They say that he had
just insured his house. And he said that I and my
mother came and threatened him. It is true, I abused
him at that time&mdash;couldn't help it&mdash;but I did not set the
fire, and was not even in the neighborhood when the fire
started. He set the fire purposely on the day I was there
with my mother. He did it for the insurance money, and
threw it on us."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"As true as there is a living God, master. Do help
us!" He was about to bow to the ground, but Nekhludoff
forcibly prevented him. "Release me. I am suffering
here innocently," he continued. His face suddenly began
to twitch; tears welled up in his eyes, and, rolling up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>sleeve of his coat, he began to wipe his eyes with the
dirty sleeve of his shirt.</p>

<p>"Have you finished?" asked the warden.</p>

<p>"Yes. Cheer up; I will do what I can for you," Nekhludoff
said, and walked out. Menshov stood in the door,
so that when the warden closed it he pushed him in.
While the warden was locking the door, Menshov looked
through the hole.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI"></a>CHAPTER LI.</h2>


<p>It was dinner time when Nekhludoff retraced his steps
through the wide corridor, and the cells were open. The
prisoners, in light yellow coats, short, wide trousers and
prison shoes, eyed him greedily. Nekhludoff experienced
strange feelings and commiseration for the prisoners, and,
for some reason, shame that he should so calmly view it.</p>

<p>In one of the corridors a man, clattering with his prison
shoes, ran into one of the cells, and immediately a crowd
of people came out, placed themselves in his way, and
bowed.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency&mdash;I don't know what to call you&mdash;please
order that our case be decided."</p>

<p>"I am not the commander. I do not know anything."</p>

<p>"No matter. Tell them, the authorities, or somebody,"
said an indignant voice, "to look into our case. We are
guilty of no offense, and have been in prison the second
month now."</p>

<p>"How so? Why?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"We don't know ourselves why, but we have been here
the second month."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the assistant inspector. "They
were taken because they had no passports, and they were
to be transported to their district, but the prison had
burned down there, and the authorities asked us to keep
them here. Those belonging to other districts were transported,
but these we keep here."</p>

<p>"Is that the only reason?" asked Nekhludoff, stopping
in the doorway.</p>

<p>The crowd, consisting of about forty men, all in prison
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>garb, surrounded Nekhludoff and the assistant. Several
voices began talking at once. The assistant stopped them.</p>

<p>"Let one of you speak."</p>

<p>A tall old man of good mien came forward. He told
Nekhludoff that they were all imprisoned on the ground
that they had no passports, but that, as a matter of fact,
they had passports which had expired and were not renewed
for about two weeks. It happened every year, but
they were never even fined. And now they were imprisoned
like criminals.</p>

<p>"We are all masons and belong to the same association.
They say that the prison has burned down, but that isn't
our fault. For God's sake, help us!"</p>

<p>Nekhludoff listened, but scarcely understood what the
old man was saying.</p>

<p>"How is that? Can it be possible that they are kept
in prison for that sole reason?" said Nekhludoff, turning
to the assistant.</p>

<p>"Yes, they ought to be sent to their homes," said the
assistant.</p>

<p>At that moment a small-sized man, also in prison attire,
pushed his way through the crowd and began to complain
excitedly that they were being tortured without any cause.</p>

<p>"Worse than dogs&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! do not talk too much, or else you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Know what?" said the little man desperately. "Are
we guilty of anything?"</p>

<p>"Silence!" shouted the assistant, and the little man
subsided.</p>

<p>"What a peculiar state of things!" Nekhludoff said to
himself as he ran the gauntlet, as it were, of a hundred
eyes that followed him through the corridor.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that innocent people are held in durance
here?" Nekhludoff said, when they emerged from the
corridor.</p>

<p>"What can we do? However, many of them are lying.
If you ask them, they all claim to be innocent," said the
assistant inspector; "although some are there really without
any cause whatever."</p>

<p>"But these masons don't seem to be guilty of any offense."</p>

<p>"That is true so far as the masons are concerned. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>those people are spoiled. Some measure of severity is
necessary. They are not all as innocent as they look.
Only yesterday we were obliged to punish two of them."</p>

<p>"Punish, how?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"By flogging. It was ordered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But corporal punishment has been abolished."</p>

<p>"Not for those that have been deprived of civil rights."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff recalled what he had seen the other day
while waiting in the vestibule, and understood that the
punishment had then been taking place, and with peculiar
force came upon him that mingled feeling of curiosity,
sadness, doubt, and moral, almost passing over into physical,
nausea which he had felt before, but never with such
force.</p>

<p>Without listening to the assistant or looking around
him, he hastily passed through the corridor and ascended
to the office. The inspector was in the corridor, and,
busying himself with some affair, had forgot to send for
Bogodukhovskaia. He only called it to mind when Nekhludoff
entered the office.</p>

<p>"I will send for her immediately. Take a seat," he
said.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII"></a>CHAPTER LII.</h2>


<p>The office consisted of two rooms. In the first room,
which had two dirty windows and the plastering on the
walls peeled off, a black measuring rod, for determining
the height of prisoners, stood in one corner, while in
another hung a picture of Christ. A few wardens stood
around in this room. In the second room, in groups and
pairs, about twenty men and women were sitting along
the walls, talking in low voices. A writing table stood
near one of the windows.</p>

<p>The inspector seated himself at the writing table and
offered Nekhludoff a chair standing near by. Nekhludoff
seated himself and began to examine the people in the
room.</p>

<p>His attention was first of all attracted by a young man
with a pleasant face, wearing a short jacket, who was
standing before a man prisoner and a girl, gesticulating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>and talking to them in a heated manner. Beside them
sat an old man in blue eye-glasses, immovably holding
the hand of a woman in prison garb and listening to her.
A boy in high-school uniform, with an expression of fright
on his face, stood gazing on the old man. Not far from
them, in the corner, a pair of lovers were sitting. She
was a very young, pretty, stylishly-dressed girl with short-cropped,
flaxen hair and an energetic face; he was a fine-featured,
handsome youth, with wavy hair, and in a prison
coat. They occupied the corner, whispering to each other,
apparently wrapped in their love. Nearest of all to the
table was a gray-haired woman in black, evidently the
mother of a consumptive young man in a rubber jacket,
who stood before her. Her eyes were fixed on him, and
her tears prevented her speaking, which she several times
attempted to do, but was forced to desist. The young
man held a piece of paper in his hand, and, evidently not
knowing what to do, with an angry expression on his face
was folding and crumpling it. Sitting beside the weeping
mother, and patting her on the shoulder, was a stout,
pretty girl with red cheeks, in a gray dress and cape.
Everything in this girl was beautiful&mdash;the white hands,
the wavy, short hair, the strong nose and lips; but the
principal charm of her face were her hazel, kindly, truthful,
sheep eyes. Her beautiful eyes turned on Nekhludoff
at the moment he entered, and met his. But she immediately
turned them again on her mother, and whispered
to her something. Not far from the lovers a dark man
with gloomy face sat talking angrily to a clean-shaven
visitor resembling a Skopetz (a sect of castrates). At the
very door stood a young man in a rubber jacket, evidently
more concerned about the impression he was making on
the visitors than what he was saying. Nekhludoff sat
down beside the inspector and looked around him with
intense curiosity. He was amused by a short-haired boy
coming near him and asking him in a shrill voice:</p>

<p>"And whom are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>The question surprised Nekhludoff, but, seeing the
boy's serious, intelligent face, with bright, attentive eyes,
gravely answered that he was awaiting a woman acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Well, is she your sister?" asked the boy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>"No, she is not my sister," Nekhludoff answered with
surprise. "And with whom are you?"</p>

<p>"I am with mamma. She is a political," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Maria Pavlovna, take away Kolia!" said the inspector,
evidently finding Nekhludoff's conversation with the boy
contrary to the law.</p>

<p>Maria Pavlovna, the same beautiful woman who had attracted
Nekhludoff's attention, rose and with heavy, long
strides approached him.</p>

<p>"What is he asking you? Who you are?" she asked,
slightly smiling with her beautifully curved lips, and
confidingly looking at him with her prominent, kindly
eyes, as though expecting Nekhludoff to know that her
relations to everybody always have been, are and ought
to be simple, affable, and brotherly. "He must know
everything," she said, and smiled into the face of the
boy with such a kindly, charming smile that both the boy
and Nekhludoff involuntarily also smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, he asked me whom I came to see."</p>

<p>"Maria Pavlovna, you know that it is not permitted to
speak to strangers," said the inspector.</p>

<p>"All right," she said, and, taking the little hand of the
boy into her own white hand, she returned to the consumptive's
mother.</p>

<p>"Whose boy is that?" Nekhludoff asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"He is the son of a political prisoner, and was born in
prison."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and now he is following his mother to Siberia."</p>

<p>"And that girl?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer it," said the inspector, shrugging his
shoulders. "Ah, there is Bogodukhovskaia."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIII" id="CHAPTER_LIII"></a>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>


<p>The short-haired, lean, yellow-faced Vera Efremovna,
with her large, kindly eyes, entered timidly through the
rear door.</p>

<p>"Well, I thank you for coming here," she said, pressing
Nekhludoff's hand. "You remember me? Let us
sit down."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>"I did not expect to find you here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am doing excellently&mdash;so well, indeed, that I
desire nothing better," said Vera Efremovna, looking
frightened, as usual, with her kindly, round eyes at Nekhludoff,
and turning her very thin, sinewy neck, which
projected from under the crumpled, dirty collar of her
waist.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff asked her how she came to be in prison.
She related her case to him with great animation. Her
discourse was interspersed with foreign scientific terms
about propaganda, disorganization, groups, sections and
sub-sections, which, she was perfectly certain, everybody
knew, but of which Nekhludoff had never even heard.</p>

<p>She was evidently sure that it was both interesting and
pleasant to him to know all that she was relating. Nekhludoff,
however, looked at her pitiful neck, her thin,
tangled hair, and wondered why she was telling him all
that. He pitied her, but not as he pitied the peasant
Menshov with his hands and face white as potato sprouts,
and innocently languishing in an ill-smelling prison. He
pitied her on account of the evident confusion that
reigned in her head. She seemed to consider herself a
heroine, and showed off before him. And this made her
particularly pitiful. This trait Nekhludoff noticed in
other people then in the room. His arrival attracted
their attention, and he felt that they changed their demeanor
because of his presence. This trait was also
present in the young man in the rubber jacket, in the
woman in prison clothes, and even in the actions of the
two lovers. The only people who did not possess this
trait were the consumptive young man, the beautiful girl
with sheep eyes, and the dark-featured man who was talking
to the beardless man who resembled a Skopetz.</p>

<p>The affair of which Vera Efremovna wished to speak
to Nekhludoff consisted of the following: A chum of hers,
Shustova, who did not even belong to her sub-section,
was arrested because in her dwelling were found books
and papers which had been left with her for safe keeping.
Vera Efremovna thought that it was partly her
fault that Shustova was imprisoned, and implored Nekhludoff,
who was well connected, to do everything in his
power to effect her release.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Of herself, she related that, after having graduated as
midwife, she joined some party. At first everything went
on <a name="smoothly" id="smoothly"></a>smoothly, but afterward one of the party was caught,
the papers were seized, and then all were taken in a police
drag-net.</p>

<p>"They also took me, and now I am going to be transported,"
she wound up her story. "But that is nothing.
I feel excellently," and she smiled piteously.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff asked her about the girl with the sheep
eyes, and Vera Efremovna told him that she was the
daughter of a general, that she had assumed the guilt
of another person, and was now going to serve at hard
labor in Siberia.</p>

<p>"An altruistic, honest person," said Vera Efremovna.</p>

<p>The other case of which Vera Efremovna wished to
speak concerned Maslova. As the history of every prisoner
was known to everyone in prison, she knew Maslova's
history, and advised him to procure her removal
to the ward for politicals, or, at least, to the hospital,
which was just now crowded, requiring a larger staff of
nurses.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff said that he could hardly do anything, but
promised to make an attempt when he reached St. Petersburg.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIV" id="CHAPTER_LIV"></a>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>


<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the inspector,
who announced that it was time to depart. Nekhludoff
rose, took leave of Vera Efremovna, and strode to the
door, where he stopped to observe what was taking place
before him.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, the time is up," said the inspector
as he was going out. But neither visitors nor
prisoners stirred.</p>

<p>The inspector's demand only called forth greater animation,
but no one thought of departing. Some got up and
talked standing; some continued to talk sitting; others
began to cry and take leave. The young man continued
to crumple the bit of paper, and he made such a good
effort to remain calm that his face seemed to bear an angry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>expression. His mother, hearing that the visit was over,
fell on his shoulder and began to sob. The girl with the
sheep eyes&mdash;Nekhludoff involuntarily followed her movements&mdash;stood
before the sobbing mother, pouring words
of consolation into her ear. The old man with the blue
eye-glasses held his daughter by the hand and nodded
affirmatively to her words. The young lovers rose, holding
each other's hands and silently looking into each
other's eyes.</p>

<p>"Those are the only happy people here," said the young
man in the rubber jacket who stood near Nekhludoff,
pointing to the young lovers.</p>

<p>Seeing the glances of Nekhludoff and the young man,
the lovers&mdash;the convict and the flaxen-haired girl&mdash;stretched
their clasping hands, threw back their heads,
and began to dance in a circle.</p>

<p>"They will be married this evening in the prison, and
she will go with him to Siberia," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Who is he, then?"</p>

<p>"He is a penal convict. Although they are making
merry, it is very painful to listen," added the young man,
listening to the sobbing of the old man with the blue
eye-glasses.</p>

<p>"Please, please don't compel me to take severe measures,"
said the inspector, several times repeating the same
thing. "Please, please," he said, weakly and irresolutely.
"Well, now, this cannot go on. Please, now come. For
the last time I repeat it," he said, in a sad voice, seating
himself and rising again; lighting and then extinguishing
his cigarette.</p>

<p>Finally the prisoners and visitors began to depart&mdash;the
former passing through the inner, the latter through the
outer, door. First the man in the rubber coat passed out;
then the consumptive and the dark-featured convict; next
Vera Efremovna and Maria Pavlovna, and the boy who
was born in the prison.</p>

<p>The visitors also filed out. The old man with the blue
eye-glasses started with a heavy gait, and after him came
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"What a peculiar state of things!" said the talkative
young man to Nekhludoff on the stairs, as though continuing
the interrupted conversation. "It is fortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>that the captain is a kind-hearted man, and does not enforce
the rules. But for him it would be tantalizing.
As it is, they talk together and relieve their feelings."</p>

<p>When Nekhludoff, talking to this man, who gave his
name as Medyntzev, reached the entrance-hall, the inspector,
with weary countenance, approached him.</p>

<p>"So, if you wish to see Maslova, then please call to-morrow,"
he said, evidently desiring to be pleasant.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Nekhludoff, and hastened away. As
on the former occasion, besides pity he was seized with
a feeling of doubt and a sort of moral nausea.</p>

<p>"What is all that for?" he asked himself, but found
no answer.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LV" id="CHAPTER_LV"></a>CHAPTER LV.</h2>


<p>On the following day Nekhludoff drove to the lawyer
and told him of the Menshovs' case, asking him to take
up their defense. The lawyer listened to him attentively,
and said that if the facts were really as told to Nekhludoff,
he would undertake their defense without compensation.
Nekhludoff also told him of the hundred and thirty
men kept in prison through some misunderstanding, and
asked him whose fault he thought it was. The lawyer
was silent for a short while, evidently desiring to give
an accurate answer.</p>

<p>"Whose fault it is? No one's," he said decisively. "If
you ask the prosecutor, he will tell you that it is Maslenikoff's
fault, and if you ask Maslenikoff, he will tell you
that it is the prosecutor's fault. It is no one's fault."</p>

<p>"I will go to Maslenikoff and tell him."</p>

<p>"That is useless," the lawyer retorted, smiling. "He
is&mdash;he is not your friend or relative, is he? He is such
a blockhead, and, saving your presence, at the same time
such a sly beast!"</p>

<p>Nekhludoff recalled what Maslenikoff had said about
the lawyer, made no answer, and, taking leave, directed
his steps toward Maslenikoff's residence.</p>

<p>Two things Nekhludoff wanted of Maslenikoff. First,
to obtain Maslova's transfer to the hospital, and to help,
if possible, the hundred and thirty unfortunates. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>Although
it was hard for him to be dealing with this man,
and especially to ask favors of him, yet it was the only
way of gaining his end, and he had to go through it.</p>

<p>As Nekhludoff approached Maslenikoff's house, he saw
a number of carriages, cabs and traps standing in front
of it, and he recalled that this was the reception day to
which he had been invited. While Nekhludoff was approaching
the house a carriage was standing near the
curb, opposite the door, and a lackey in a cockaded silk
hat and cape, was seating a lady, who, raising the long
train of her skirt, displayed the sharp joints of her toes
through the thin slippers. Among the carriages he
recognized the covered landau of the Korchagins. The
gray-haired, rosy-cheeked driver deferentially raised his
hat. Nekhludoff had scarcely asked the porter where
Michael Ivanovich (Maslenikoff) was, when the latter
appeared on the carpeted stairway, escorting a very important
guest, such as he usually escorted not to the upper
landing, but to the vestibule. This very important military
guest, while descending the stairs, was conversing
in French about a lottery for the benefit of orphan
asylums, giving his opinion that it was a good occupation
for ladies. "They enjoy themselves while they are
raising money."</p>

<p>"Qu'elles s'amusent et que le bon Dieu les b&eacute;nisse.
Ah, Nekhludoff, how do you do? You haven't shown
yourself for a long time," he greeted Nekhludoff. "Allez
pr&eacute;senter vos devoirs &agrave; madame. The Korchagins are
here, too. Toutes les jolies femmes de la ville," he said,
holding out and somewhat raising his military shoulders
for his overcoat, which was being placed on him by his
own magnificent lackey in gold-braided uniform. "Au
revoir, mon cher." Then he shook Maslenikoff's hand.</p>

<p>"Well, now let us go upstairs. How glad I am," Maslenikoff
began excitedly, seizing Nekhludoff by the arm,
and, notwithstanding his corpulence, nimbly leading him
up the stairs. Maslenikoff was in a particularly happy
mood, which Nekhludoff could not help ascribing to the
attention shown him by the important person. Every
attention shown him by an important person put him into
such an ecstasy as may be observed in a fawning little
dog when its master pats it, strokes it, and scratches under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>its ears. It wags its tail, shrinks, wriggles, and, straightening
its ears, madly runs in a circle. Maslenikoff was
ready to do the same thing. He did not notice the grave
expression on Nekhludoff's face, nor hear what he was
saying, but irresistibly dragged him into the reception-room.
Nekhludoff involuntarily followed.</p>

<p>"Business afterward. I will do anything you wish,"
said Maslenikoff, leading him through the parlor. "Announce
Prince Nekhludoff to Her Excellency," he said
on the way to a lackey. The lackey, in an ambling gait,
ran ahead of them. "Vous n'avez qu'&agrave; ordonner. But
you must see my wife without fail. She would not forgive
my failure to present you last time you were here."</p>

<p>The lackey had already announced him when they entered,
and Anna Ignatievna, the vice-governess&mdash;Mrs.
General, as she called herself&mdash;sat on a couch surrounded
by ladies. As Nekhludoff approached she was already
leaning forward with a radiant smile on her face. At
the other end of the reception-room women sat around
a table, while men in military uniforms and civil attire
stood over them. An incessant cackle came from that
direction.</p>

<p>"Enfin! Why do you estrange yourself? Have we
offended you in any way?"</p>

<p>With these words, presupposing an intimacy between
her and Nekhludoff, which never existed, Anna Ignatievna
greeted him.</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted? Madam Beliavskaia&mdash;Michael
Ivanovich Chernoff. Take a seat here."</p>

<p>"Missy, venez donc &agrave; notre table. On vous opportera
votre th&eacute;. And you," she turned to the officer who was
conversing with Missy, evidently forgetting his name,
"come here, please. Will you have some tea, Prince?"</p>

<p>"No, no; I will never agree with you. She simply did
not love him," said a woman's voice.</p>

<p>"But she loved pie."</p>

<p>"Eternally those stupid jests," laughingly interfered
another lady in a high hat and dazzling with gold and
diamonds.</p>

<p>"C'est excellent, these waffles, and so light! Let us
have some more."</p>

<p>"Well, how soon are you going to leave us?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>"Yes, this is the last day. That is why we came here."</p>

<p>"Such a beautiful spring! How pleasant it is in the
country!"</p>

<p>Missy in her hat and some dark, striped dress which
clasped her waist without a wrinkle, was very pretty.
She blushed when she saw Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I thought you had left the city," she said to him.</p>

<p>"Almost. Business keeps me here. I come here also
for business."</p>

<p>"Call on mamma. She is very anxious to see you," she
said, and, feeling that she was lying, and that he understood
it, her face turned a still deeper purple.</p>

<p>"I shall hardly have the time," gloomily answered
Nekhludoff, pretending not to see that she was blushing.</p>

<p>Missy frowned angrily, shrugged her shoulders, and
turned to an elegant officer, who took from her hands the
empty teacup and valiantly carried it to another table,
his sword striking every object it encountered.</p>

<p>"You must also contribute toward the asylum."</p>

<p>"I am not refusing, only I wish to keep my contribution
for the lottery. There I will show all my liberality."</p>

<p>"Don't forget, now," a plainly dissimulating laugh was
heard.</p>

<p>The reception day was brilliant, and Anna Ignatievna
was delighted.</p>

<p>"Mika told me that you busy yourself in the prisons.
I understand it very well," she said to Nekhludoff.
"Mika"&mdash;she meant her stout husband, Maslenikoff&mdash;"may
have his faults, but you know that he is kind. All
these unfortunate prisoners are his children. He does
not look on them in any other light. Il est d'une
bont&eacute;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, not finding words to express bont&eacute; of a
husband, and immediately, smiling, turned to an old,
wrinkled woman in lilac-colored bows who had just entered.</p>

<p>Having talked as much and as meaninglessly as it was
necessary to preserve the decorum, Nekhludoff arose and
went over to Maslenikoff.</p>

<p>"Will you please hear me now?"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes. Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Come in here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>They entered a small Japanese cabinet and seated themselves
near the window.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVI" id="CHAPTER_LVI"></a>CHAPTER LVI.</h2>


<p>"Well, je suis &agrave; vous. Will you smoke a cigarette?
But wait; we must not soil the things here," and he
brought an ash-holder. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I want two things of you."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>Maslenikoff's face became gloomy and despondent.
All traces of that animation of the little dog whom its
master had scratched under the ears entirely disappeared.
Voices came from the reception-room. One, a woman's
voice, said: "Jamais, jamais je ne croirais;" another, a
man's voice from the other corner, was telling something,
constantly repeating: "La Comtesse Vorouzoff" and
"Victor Apraksine." From the third side only a humming
noise mingled with laughter was heard. Maslenikoff
listened to the voices; so did Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you again about that woman."</p>

<p>"Yes; who was innocently condemned. I know, I
know."</p>

<p>"I would like her to be transferred to the hospital. I
was told that it can be done."</p>

<p>Maslenikoff pursed up his lips and began to meditate.</p>

<p>"It can hardly be done," he said. "However, I will
consult about it, and will wire you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I was told that there are many sick people in the
hospital, and they need assistants."</p>

<p>"Well, yes. But I will let you know, as I said."</p>

<p>"Please do," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>There was a burst of general and even natural laughter
in the reception-room.</p>

<p>"That is caused by Victor," said Maslenikoff, smiling.
"He is remarkably witty when in high spirits."</p>

<p>"Another thing," said Nekhludoff. "There are a hundred
and thirty men languishing in prison for the only
reason that their passports were not renewed in time.
They have been in prison now for a month."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>And he related the causes that kept them there.</p>

<p>"How did you come to know it?" asked <a name="Maslenikoff" id="Maslenikoff"></a>Nekhludoff,
and his face showed disquietude and displeasure.</p>

<p>"I was visiting a prisoner, and these people surrounded
me and asked&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What prisoner were you visiting?"</p>

<p>"The peasant who is innocently accused, and for whom
I have obtained counsel. But that is not to the point.
Is it possible that these innocent people are kept in prison
only because they failed to renew their passports?"</p>

<p>"That is the prosecutor's business," interrupted Maslenikoff,
somewhat vexed. "Now, you say that trials
must be speedy and just. It is the duty of the assistant
prosecutor to visit the prisons and see that no one is
innocently kept there. But these assistants do nothing
but play cards."</p>

<p>"So you can do nothing for them?" Nekhludoff asked
gloomily, recalling the words of the lawyer, that the
governor would shift the responsibility.</p>

<p>"I will see to it. I will make inquiries immediately."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for her. C'est un souffre-douleur,"
came from the reception-room, the voice of a woman apparently
entirely indifferent to what she was saying.</p>

<p>"So much the better; I will take this," from the other
side was heard a man's playful voice, and the merry
laughter of a woman who refused him something.</p>

<p>"No, no, for no consideration," said a woman's voice.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will do everything," repeated Maslenikoff,
extinguishing the cigarette with his white hand, on
which was a turquoise ring. "Now, let us go to the
ladies."</p>

<p>"And yet another question," said Nekhludoff, without
going into the reception-room, and stopping at the door.
"I was told that some people in the prison were subjected
to corporal punishment. Is it true?"</p>

<p>Maslenikoff's face flushed.</p>

<p>"Ah! you have reference to that affair? No, mon cher,
you must positively not be admitted there&mdash;you want to
know everything. Come, come; Annette is calling us,"
he said, seizing Nekhludoff's arm with the same excitement
he evinced after the attention shown him by the important
person, but this time alarming, and not joyful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>Nekhludoff tore himself loose, and, without bowing or
saying anything, gloomily passed through the reception-room,
the parlor and by the lackeys, who sprang to their
feet in the ante-chamber, to the street.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with him? What did you do to
him?" Annette asked her husband.</p>

<p>"That is &agrave; la fran&ccedil;aise," said some one.</p>

<p>"Rather &agrave; la zoulon."</p>

<p>"Oh, he has always been queer."</p>

<p>Some one arose, some one arrived, and the chirping
continued.</p>

<p>The following morning Nekhludoff received from Maslenikoff
a letter on heavy, glossy paper, bearing a coat-of-arms
and seals, written in a fine, firm hand, in which
he said that he had written to the prison physician asking
that Maslova be transferred, and that he hoped his request
would be acceded to. It was signed, "Your loving
senior comrade," followed by a remarkably skillful
flourish.</p>

<p>"Fool!" Nekhludoff could not help exclaiming, especially
because he felt that by the word "comrade" Maslenikoff
was condescending, i.&nbsp;e., although he considered
himself a very important personage, he nevertheless was
not too proud of his greatness, and called himself his
comrade.</p>

<p>One of the most popular superstitions consists in the
belief that every man is endowed with definite qualities&mdash;that
some men are kind, some wicked; some wise, some
foolish; some energetic, some apathetic, etc. This is not
true. We may say of a man that he is oftener kind than
wicked; oftener wise than foolish; oftener energetic than
apathetic, and vice versa. But it would not be true to
say of one man that he is always kind or wise, and of another
that he is always wicked or foolish. And yet we
thus divide people. This is erroneous. Men are like
rivers&mdash;the water in all of them, and at every point, is
the same, but every one of them is now narrow, now
swift, now wide, now calm, now clear, now cold, now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>muddy, now warm. So it is with men. Every man bears
within him the germs of all human qualities, sometimes
manifesting one quality, sometimes another; and often
does not resemble himself at all, manifesting no change.
With some people these changes are particularly sharp.
And to this class Nekhludoff belonged. These changes
in him had both physical and spiritual causes; and one of
these changes he was now undergoing.</p>

<p>That feeling of solemnity and joy of rejuvenation which
he had experienced after the trial and after his first meeting
with Katiousha had passed away, and, after the last
meeting, fear and even disgust toward her had taken its
place. He was also conscious that his duty was burdensome
to him. He had decided not to leave her, to carry
out his intention of marrying her, if she so desired; but
this was painful and tormenting to him.</p>

<p>On the day following his visit to Maslenikoff he again
went to the prison to see her.</p>

<p>The inspector permitted him to see her; not in the
office, however, nor in the lawyer's room, but in the
women's visiting-room. Notwithstanding his kind-heartedness,
the inspector was more reserved than formerly.
Evidently Nekhludoff's conversations with Maslenikoff
had resulted in instructions being given to be
more careful with this visitor.</p>

<p>"You may see her," he said, "only please remember
what I told you as to giving her money. And as to her
transfer to the hospital, about which His Excellency has
written, there is no objection to it, and the physician also
consented. But she herself does not wish it. 'I don't
care to be chambermaid to that scurvy lot,' she said.
That is the kind of people they are, Prince," he added.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff made no answer and asked to be admitted
to her. The inspector sent the warden, and Nekhludoff
followed him into the empty visiting-room.</p>

<p>Maslova was already there, quietly and timidly emerging
from behind the grating. She approached close to
Nekhludoff, and, looking past him, quietly said:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Dmitri Ivanovich; I have spoken improperly
the other day."</p>

<p>"It is not for me to forgive you&mdash;&mdash;" Nekhludoff began.</p>

<p>"But you must leave me," she added, and in the fearfully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>squinting eyes with which she glanced at him Nekhludoff
again saw a strained and spiteful expression.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a name="EASTER_SERVICES" id="EASTER_SERVICES"></a>
<a href="images/image196.jpg">
<img src="images/image196.jpg" width="600" alt="EASTER SERVICES."

<span class="caption">EASTER SERVICES.</span>
</p>

<p>"But why should I leave you?"</p>

<p>"So."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>She again looked at him with that spiteful glance, as
it seemed to him.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will tell you," she said. "You leave
me&mdash;I tell you that truly. I cannot. You must drop
that entirely," she said, with quivering lips, and became
silent. "That is true. I would rather hang myself."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff felt that in this answer lurked a hatred
for him, an unforgiven wrong, but also something else&mdash;something
good and important. This reiteration of her
refusal in a perfectly calm state destroyed in Nekhludoff's
soul all his doubts, and brought him back to his former
grave, solemn and benign state of mind.</p>

<p>"Katiousha, I repeat what I said," he said, with particular
gravity. "I ask you to marry me. If, however,
you do not wish to, and so long as you do not wish to,
I will be wherever you will be, and follow you wherever
you may be sent."</p>

<p>"That is your business. I will speak no more," she
said, and again her lips quivered.</p>

<p>He was also silent, feeling that he had no strength
to speak.</p>

<p>"I am now going to the country, and from there to St.
Petersburg," he said finally. "I will press your&mdash;our
case, and with God's help the sentence will be set aside."</p>

<p>"I don't care if they don't. I deserved it, if not for
that, for something else," she said, and he saw what great
effort she had to make to repress her tears.</p>

<p>"Well, have you seen Menshova?" she asked suddenly,
in order to hide her agitation. "They are innocent, are
they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"Such a wonderful little woman!" she said.</p>

<p>He related everything he had learned from Menshova,
and asked her if she needed anything. She said she needed
nothing.</p>

<p>They were silent again.</p>

<p>"Well, and as to the hospital," she said suddenly, casting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>on him her squinting glance, "if you wish me to go,
I will go; and I will stop wine drinking, too."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff silently looked in her eyes. They were
smiling.</p>

<p>"That is very good," was all he could say.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; she is an entirely different person," thought
Nekhludoff, for the first time experiencing, after his former
doubts, the to him entirely new feeling of confidence
in the invincibility of love.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Returning to her ill-smelling cell, Maslova removed her
coat and sat down on her cot, her hands resting on her
knees. In the cell were only the consumptive with her
babe, the old woman, Menshova, and the watch-woman
with her two children. The deacon's daughter had been
removed to the hospital; the others were washing.
The old woman lay on the cot sleeping; the children were
in the corridor, the door to which was open. The consumptive
with the child in her arms and the watch-woman,
who did not cease knitting a stocking with her nimble
fingers, approached Maslova.</p>

<p>"Well, have you seen him?" they asked.</p>

<p>Maslova dangled her feet, which did not reach the floor,
and made no answer.</p>

<p>"What are you whimpering about?" said the watch-woman.
"Above all, keep up your spirits. Oh, Katiousha!
Well?" she said, rapidly moving her fingers.</p>

<p>Maslova made no answer.</p>

<p>"The women went washing. They say that to-day's
alms were larger. Many things have been brought, they
say," said the consumptive.</p>

<p>"Finashka!" shouted the watch-woman. "Where are
you, you little rogue?" She drew out one of the knitting
needles, stuck it into the ball of thread and stocking, and
went out into the corridor.</p>

<p>At this moment the inmates of the cell, with bare feet
in their prison shoes, entered, each bearing a loaf of twisted
bread, some even two. Theodosia immediately approached
Maslova.</p>

<p>"Why, anything wrong?" she asked, lovingly, looking
with her bright, blue eyes at Maslova. "And here is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>something for our tea," and she placed the leaves on the
shelf.</p>

<p>"Well, has he changed his mind about marrying you?"
asked Korableva.</p>

<p>"No, he has not, but I do not wish to," answered Maslova,
"and I told him so."</p>

<p>"What a fool!" said Korableva, in her basso voice.</p>

<p>"What is the good of marrying if they cannot live
together?" asked Theodosia.</p>

<p>"Is not your husband going with you?" answered the
watch-woman.</p>

<p>"We are legally married," said Theodosia. "But why
should he marry her legally if he cannot live with her?"</p>

<p>"What a fool! Why, if he marries her he will make
her rich!"</p>

<p>"He said: 'Wherever you may be, I will be with you,'"
said Maslova.</p>

<p>"He may go if he likes; he needn't if he don't. I will
not ask him. He is now going to St. Petersburg to try to
get me out. All the ministers there are his relatives,"
she continued, "but I don't care for them."</p>

<p>"Sure enough," Korableva suddenly assented, reaching
down into her bag, and evidently thinking of something
else. "What do you say&mdash;shall we have some wine?"</p>

<p>"Not I," answered Maslova. "Drink yourselves."</p>

<p>The Senate could hear the case in two weeks, and by
that time Nekhludoff intended to be in St. Petersburg,
and, in case of an adverse decision, to petition the Emperor,
as the lawyer had advised. In case the appeal
failed, for which, his lawyer had told him, he must be prepared,
as the grounds of appeal were very weak, the party
of convicts to which Maslova belonged would be transported
in May. It was therefore necessary, in order to
be prepared to follow Maslova to Siberia, upon which
Nekhludoff was firmly resolved, to go to the villages and
arrange his affairs there.</p>

<p>First of all, he went to the Kusminskoie estate, the nearest,
largest black-earth estate, which brought the greatest
income. He had lived on the estate in his childhood and
youth, and had also twice visited it in his manhood, once
when, upon the request of his mother, he brought a German
manager with whom he went over the affairs of the
estate. So that he knew its condition and the relations
the peasants sustained toward the office, i.&nbsp;e., the landowner.
Their relations toward the office were such that
they have always been in absolute dependence upon it.
Nekhludoff had already known it when as a student he
professed and preached the doctrines of Henry George,
and in carrying out which he had distributed his father's
estate among the peasants. True, after his military
career, when he was spending twenty thousand rubles a
year, those doctrines ceased to be necessary to the life he
was leading, were forgotten, and not only did he not ask
himself where the money came from, but tried not to
think of it. But the death of his mother, the inheritance,
and the necessity of taking care of his property, i.&nbsp;e., his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>lands, again raised the question in his mind of his relation
to private ownership of land. A month before Nekhludoff
would have argued that he was powerless to change
the existing order of things; that he was not managing
the estate, and living and receiving his income far away
from the estate, would feel more or less at ease. But
now he resolved that, although there was before him a
trip to Siberia and complex and difficult relations to the
prison world, for which social standing, and especially
money, were necessary, he could not, nevertheless, leave
his affairs in their former condition, but must, to his own
detriment, change them. For this purpose he had decided
not to work the land himself, but, by renting it at
a low price to the peasants, to make it possible for them
to live independent of the landlord. Often, while comparing
the position of the landlord with that of the owner
of serfs, Nekhludoff found a parallel in the renting of
the land to the peasants, instead of working it by hired
labor, to what the slave-owners did when they substituted
tenancy for serfdom. That did not solve the question,
but it was a step toward its solution; it was a transition
from a grosser to a less gross form of ownership of man.
He also intended to act thus.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff arrived at Kusminskoie about noon. In
everything simplifying his life, he did not wire from the
station of his arrival, but hired a two-horse country coach.
The driver was a young fellow in a nankeen regulation
coat, belted below the waist, sitting sidewise on the box.
He was the more willing to carry on a conversation because
the broken-down, lame, emaciated, foaming shaft-horse
could then walk, which these horses always preferred.</p>

<p>The driver spoke about the manager of the Kusminskoie
estate, not knowing that he was carrying its master,
Nekhludoff purposely refrained from enlightening him.</p>

<p>"A dandy German," he said, turning half around, cracking
his long whip now over the heads, now under the
horses. "There is nothing here to compare with his fine
team of three bay horses. You ought to see him driving
out with his wife! I took some guests to his house last
Christmas&mdash;he had a fine tree. You couldn't find the like
of it in the whole district! He robbed everybody, right
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>and left. But what does he care? He is bossing everybody.
They say he bought a fine estate."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff thought that he was indifferent to the manner
of the German's management, and to the way he was
profiting by it. But the story of the driver with the long
waist was unpleasant to him. He was enchanted with the
fine weather; the darkening clouds, sometimes obscuring
the sun; the fields over which the larks soared; the woods,
just covering up the top and bottom with green; the
meadows on which the flocks and horses browsed, and the
fields on which plowmen were already seen&mdash;but a feeling
of dissatisfaction crept over him. And when he asked
himself the reason for it, he recalled the driver's account
of the German's management.</p>

<p>But by the time he was busying himself with the affairs
of Kusminskoie he had forgotten it.</p>

<p>After an examination of the books and his conversation
with the clerk, who artlessly set forth the advantages of
the peasants having small holdings and the fact that they
were hemmed in by the master's land, Nekhludoff grew
only more determined to put an end to his ownership, and
give the land to the peasants. From the books and his
conversations with the clerk he learned that, as before,
two-thirds of the best arable land was cultivated by his
own men, and the rest by peasants who were paid five
rubles per acre&mdash;that is to say, for five rubles the peasant
undertook to plow, harrow and sow an acre of land three
times, then mow it, bind or press it, and carry it to the
barn. In other words, he was paid five rubles for what
hired, cheap labor would cost at least ten rubles. Again,
the prices paid by the peasants to the office for necessaries
were enormous. They worked for meadow, for wood, for
potatoe seed, and they were almost all in debt to the office.
Thus, the rent charged the peasants for lands beyond
the fields was four times as great as it could bring
on a five per cent. basis.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff knew all that before, but he was now learning
it as something new, and only wondered why he and
all those who stood in a similar position could fail to see
the enormity of such relations. The arguments of the
clerk that not one-fourth of the value of the stock could be
realized on a sale, that the peasants would permit the land
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>to run to waste, only strengthened his determination and
confirmed him in his belief that he was doing a good deed
by giving the land to the peasants, and depriving himself
of the greater part of his income. Desiring to dispose of
the land forthwith, he asked the manager to call together
the peasants of the three villages surrounded by his lands
the very next day, for the purpose of declaring to them his
intention and agreeing with them as to the price.</p>

<p>With a joyful consciousness of his firmness, in spite of
the arguments of the manager, and his readiness to make
sacrifices for the peasants, Nekhludoff left the office, and,
reflecting on the coming arrangement, he strolled around
the house, through the flower-garden, which lay opposite
the manager's house, and was neglected this year; over the
lawn-tennis ground, overgrown with chicory, and through
the alleys lined with lindens, where it had been his wont to
smoke his cigar, and where, three years before, the pretty
visitor, Kirimova, flirted with him. Having made an outline
of a speech, which he was to deliver to the peasants
the following day, Nekhludoff went to the manager's
house, and after further deliberating upon the proper disposition
of the stock, he calmly and contentedly retired to
a room prepared for him in the large building.</p>

<p>In this clean room, the walls of which were covered with
views of Venice, and with a mirror hung between two windows,
there was placed a clean spring bedstead and a small
table with water and matches. On a large table near the
mirror lay his open traveling-bag with toilet articles and
books which he brought with him; one Russian book on
criminology, one in German, and a third in English treating
of the same subject. He intended to read them in
spare moments while traveling through the villages, but as
he looked on them now he felt that his mind was far from
these subjects. Something entirely different occupied
him.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room there stood an ancient arm-chair
with incrustations, and the sight of this chair standing
in his mother's bed-room suddenly raised in his soul
an unexpected feeling. He suddenly felt sorry for the
house that would decay, the gardens which would be neglected,
the woods which would be cut down, and all the
cattle-houses, courts, stables, sheds, machinery, horses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>cows which had been accumulated with such effort, although
not by him. At first it seemed to him easy to
abandon all that, but now he was loth to part with it, as
well as the land and one-half of the income which would
be so useful now. And immediately serviceable arguments
come to his aid, by which it appeared that it was
not wise to give the land to the peasants and destroy his
estate.</p>

<p>"I have no right to own the land. And if I do not own
the land, I cannot keep the property intact. Besides, I
will now go to Siberia, and for that reason I need neither
the house nor the estate," whispered one voice. "All that
is true," whispered another voice, "but you will not pass
all your life in Siberia. If you should marry, you may
have children. And you must hand over the estate to
them in the same condition in which you found it. There
are duties toward the land. It is easy to give away the
land, to destroy everything; but it is very hard to accumulate
it. Above all, you must mark out a plan of your life,
and dispose of your property accordingly. And, then, are
you acting as you do in order to satisfy conscientious
scruples, or for the praise you expect of people?" Nekhludoff
asked himself, and could not help acknowledging that
the talk that it would occasion influenced his decision.
And the more he thought the more questions raised themselves,
and the more perplexing they appeared. To rid
himself of these thoughts he lay down on the fresh-made
bed, intending to go over them again the next day with a
clearer mind. But he could not fall asleep for a long time.
Along with the fresh air, through the open window, came
the croaking of frogs, interrupted by the whistling of
nightingales, one of which was in a lilac bush under the
window. Listening to the nightingales and the frogs,
Nekhludoff recalled the music of the inspector's daughter;
and, thinking of that music, he recalled Maslova&mdash;how,
like the croaking of a frog, her lips trembled when she
said, "You must drop that." Then the German manager
descended to the frogs. He should have been held back,
but not only did he come down, but he was transformed
into Maslova and started to taunt him: "I am a convict,
and you are a Prince." "No, I shall not yield," thought
Nekhludoff, and came to. "Am I acting properly or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>improperly?"
he asked himself. "I don't know; I will know
to-morrow." And he began to descend to where the manager
and Maslova were. And there everything ended.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-II" id="CHAPTER_2-II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>With a feeling of timidity and shame Nekhludoff the
following morning, walked out to meet the peasants who
had gathered at a small square in front of the house. As
he approached them the peasants removed their caps, and
for a long time Nekhludoff could not say anything. Although
he was going to do something for the peasants
which they never dared even to think of, his conscience
was troubled. The peasants stood in a fine, drizzling rain,
waiting to hear what their master had to say, and Nekhludoff
was so confused that he could not open his mouth.
The calm, self-confident German came to his relief. This
strong, overfed man, like Nekhludoff himself, made a
striking contrast to the emaciated, wrinkled faces of the
peasants, and the bare shoulder-bones sticking out from
under their caftans.</p>

<p>"The Prince came to befriend you&mdash;to give you the
land, but you are not worthy of it," said the German.</p>

<p>"Why not worthy, Vasily Karlych? Have we not
labored for you? We are much satisfied with our late
mistress&mdash;may she enjoy eternal life!&mdash;and we are grateful
to the young Prince for thinking of us," began a red-haired
peasant with a gift of gab.</p>

<p>"We are not complaining of our masters," said a broad-faced
peasant with a long beard. "Only we are too
crowded here."</p>

<p>"That is what I called you here for&mdash;to give you the
land, if you wish it," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>The peasants were silent, as if misunderstanding him,
or incredulous.</p>

<p>"In what sense do you mean to give us the land?" asked
a middle-aged peasant in a caftan.</p>

<p>"To rent it to you, that you might use it at a low price."</p>

<p>"That is the loveliest thing," said an old man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>"If the payment is not above our means," said another.</p>

<p>"Of course we will take the land."</p>

<p>"It is our business&mdash;we get our sustenance from the
land."</p>

<p>"So much the better for you. All you have to do is to
take the money. And what sins you will spare yourself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The sin is on you," said the German. "If you would
only work and keep things in order&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We cannot, Vasily Karlych," said a lean old man with
a pointed nose. "You ask, Who let the horse feed in the
field? But who did it? Day in and day out&mdash;and every
day is as long as a year&mdash;I worked with the scythe, and
as I fell asleep the horse went among the oats. And now
you are fleecing me."</p>

<p>"You should keep order."</p>

<p>"It is easy for you to say keep order. But we have no
strength," retorted a middle-aged peasant, all covered
with hair.</p>

<p>"I told you to fence it in."</p>

<p>"You give us the timber," said an unsightly little peasant.
"When I cut a joist last summer, intending to make
a fence, you locked me up for three months in the castle
to feed the insects. There was a fence for you!"</p>

<p>"Is that true?" asked Nekhludoff of the manager.</p>

<p>"Der erste dich im dorfe," said the manager in German.
"He was caught every year in the woods. You
must learn to respect other people's property."</p>

<p>"Do we not respect you?" said an old man. "We cannot
help respecting you, because you have us in your
hands, and you are twisting us into rope."</p>

<p>"If you would only abstain from doing wrong," said
the manager. "It is pretty hard to wrong you."</p>

<p>"And who battered my face last summer? Of course,
there is no use going to law with a rich man."</p>

<p>"You only keep within bounds of the law."</p>

<p>This was evidently a wordy tourney of which the participants
hardly knew the purpose. Nekhludoff tried to
get back to business.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say? Do you wish the land, and
what price do you set on it?"</p>

<p>"It is your goods; you name the price."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>Nekhludoff set the price, and though much lower than
the prevailing price, the peasants began to bargain, finding
it high. He expected that his offer would be accepted
with pleasure, but there was no sign of satisfaction. Only
when the question was raised whether the whole community
would take the land, or have individual arrangements
did he know that it was profitable for them. For
there resulted fierce quarrels between those who wished to
exclude the weak ones and bad payers from participating
in the land, and those whom it was sought to exclude.
But the German finally arranged the price and time of
payment, and the peasants, noisily talking, returned to the
village.</p>

<p>The price was about thirty per cent. lower than the one
prevailing in the district, and Nekhludoff's income was
reduced to almost one-half, but, with money realized from
the sale of the timber and yet to be realized from the sale
of the stock, it was amply sufficient for him. Everything
seemed to be satisfactory, and yet Nekhludoff felt sad and
lonesome, but, above all, his conscience troubled him. He
saw that although the peasants spoke words of thanks,
they were not satisfied and expected something more.
The result was that while he deprived himself of much, he
failed to do that which the peasants expected.</p>

<p>On the following day, after the contract was signed,
Nekhludoff, with an unpleasant feeling of having left
something undone, seated himself in the "dandy" three-horse
team and took leave of the peasants, who were shaking
their heads in doubt and dissatisfaction. Nekhludoff
was dissatisfied with himself&mdash;he could not tell why, but
he felt sad, and was ashamed of something.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-III" id="CHAPTER_2-III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>From Kusminskoie Nekhludoff went to Panovo, the estate
left him by his aunts, and where he had first seen
Katiousha. He intended to dispose of this land in the
same manner as he disposed of the other, and also desired
to learn all there was known about Katiousha, and to find
out if it was true that their child had died.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>As he sat at the window observing the familiar scenery
of the now somewhat neglected estate, he not only recalled,
but felt himself as he was fourteen years ago;
fresh, pure and filled with the hope of endless possibilities.
But as it happens in a dream, he knew that that was gone,
and he became very sad.</p>

<p>Before breakfast he made his way to the hut of Matrena
Kharina, Katiousha's aunt, who was selling liquor
surreptitiously, for information about the child, but all he
could learn from her was that the child had died on the
way to a Moskow asylum; in proof of which the midwife
had brought a certificate.</p>

<p>On his way back he entered the huts of some peasants,
and inquired about their mode of living. The same complaints
of the paucity of land, hunger and degradation he
heard everywhere. He saw the same pinched faces,
threadbare homespuns, bare feet and bent shoulders.</p>

<p>In front of a particularly dilapidated hut stood a number
of women with children in their arms, and among them
he noticed a lean, pale-faced woman, easily holding a
bloodless child in a short garment made of pieces of stuff.
This child was incessantly smiling. Nekhludoff knew
that it was the smile of suffering. He asked who that
woman was.</p>

<p>It transpired that the woman's husband had been in
prison for the past six months&mdash;"feeding the insects"&mdash;as
they termed it, for cutting down two lindens.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff turned to the woman, Anisia.</p>

<p>"How do you fare?" he asked. "What do you live
on?"</p>

<p>"How do I live? I sometimes get some food," and she
began to sob.</p>

<p>The grave face of the child, however, spread into a
broad smile, and its thin legs began to wriggle.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff produced his pocketbook and gave the
woman ten rubles. He had scarcely made ten steps when
he was overtaken by another woman with a child; then an
old woman, and again another woman. They all spoke of
their poverty and implored his help. Nekhludoff distributed
the sixty rubles that were in his pocketbook and
returned home, i.&nbsp;e., to the wing inhabited by the clerk.
The clerk, smiling, met Nekhludoff with the information
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>that the peasants would gather in the evening, as he had
ordered. Nekhludoff thanked him and strolled about the
garden, meditating on what he had seen. "The people
are dying in large numbers, and are used to it; they have
acquired modes of living natural to a people who are becoming
extinct&mdash;the death of children, exhausting toil for
women, insufficiency of food for all, especially for the aged&mdash;all
comes and is received naturally. They were reduced
to this condition gradually, so that they cannot see the
horror of it, and bear it uncomplainingly. Afterward,
we, too, come to consider this condition natural; that it
ought to be so."</p>

<p>All this was so clear to him now that he could not cease
wondering how it was that people could not see it; that
he himself could not see that which is so patent. It was
perfectly clear that children and old people were dying
for want of milk, and they had no milk because they had
not land enough to feed the cattle and also raise bread and
hay. And he devised a scheme by which he was to give
the land to the people, and they were to pay an annual rent
which was to go to the community, to be used for common
utilities and taxes. This was not the single-tax, but it was
the nearest approach to it under present conditions. The
important part consisted in that he renounced his right to
own land.</p>

<p>When he returned to the house, the clerk, with a particularly
happy smile on his face, offered him dinner, expressing
his fear that it might spoil.</p>

<p>The table was covered with a gloomy cloth, an embroidered
towel serving as a napkin, and on the table, in
vieux-saxe, stood a soup-bowl with a broken handle, filled
with potato soup and containing the same rooster that he
had seen carried into the house on his arrival. After the
soup came the same rooster, fried with feathers, and cakes
made of cheese-curds, bountifully covered with butter and
sugar. Although the taste of it all was poor, Nekhludoff
kept on eating, being absorbed in the thoughts which
relieved him of the sadness that oppressed him on his return
from the village.</p>

<p>After dinner Nekhludoff with difficulty seated the
superserviceable clerk, and in order to make sure of himself
and at the same time to confide to some one the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>thoughts uppermost in his mind, told him of his project
and asked his opinion. The clerk smiled, as though he
had been thinking of the same thing, and was very glad to
hear it, but in reality did not understand it, not because
Nekhludoff did not express himself plainly enough, but
because, according to this project, Nekhludoff deprived
himself of advantages for the benefit of others, whereas
the truth that every man strives to obtain advantages at
the expense of others, was so firmly rooted in the clerk's
mind, that he thought that he misunderstood Nekhludoff
when the latter said that the entire income of the land was
to go into the community's treasury.</p>

<p>"I understand. So you will draw the interest on the
capital?" he said, becoming radiant.</p>

<p>"No, no. I transfer the land to them entirely."</p>

<p>"In that case you will get no income?" asked the clerk
and he ceased to smile.</p>

<p>"I relinquish that."</p>

<p>The clerk sighed deeply, then began to smile again.
Now he understood. He understood that Nekhludoff's
mind was not entirely sound, and he immediately tried to
find a way of profiting by Nekhludoff's project, and endeavored
to so construe it that he might turn it to his own
advantage.</p>

<p>When, however, he understood that there was no such
opportunity, he ceased to take interest in the projects, and
continued to smile only to please his master. Seeing that
the clerk could not understand him, Nekhludoff dismissed
him from his presence, seated himself at the ink-stained
table and proceeded to commit his project to paper.</p>

<p>The sun was already descending behind the unfolding
lindens, and the mosquitos filled the room, stinging him.
While he was finishing his notes, Nekhludoff heard the
lowing of cattle in the village, the creaking of the opening
gates and the voices of the peasants who were coming to
meet their master. Nekhludoff told the clerk not to call
them before the office, that he would go and meet them
at any place in the village, and gulping down a glass of
tea offered him by the clerk, he went to the village.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-IV" id="CHAPTER_2-IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>The crowd stood talking in front of the house of the
bailiff, and as Nekhludoff approached, the conversation
ceased and the peasants, like those of Kusminskoie, removed
their caps. It was a coarser crowd than the peasants
of Kusminskoie, and almost all the peasants wore
bast shoes and homespun shirts and caftans. Some of
them were bare-footed and only in their shirts.</p>

<p>With some effort Nekhludoff began his speech by declaring
that he intended to surrender the land to them.
The peasants were silent, and there was no change in the
expression of their faces.</p>

<p>"Because I consider," said Nekhludoff, blushing, "that
every man ought to have the right to use the land."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly." "That is quite right," voices of peasants
were heard.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff continued, saying that the income from the
land should be distributed among all, and he therefore proposed
that they take the land and pay into the common
treasury such rent as they may decide upon, such money
to be used for their own benefit. Exclamations of consent
and approbation continued to be heard, but the faces
of the peasants became more and more grave, and the
eyes that at first were fixed on the master were lowered,
as if desiring not to shame him with the fact that his cunning
was understood by all, and that he could not fool anybody.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff spoke very clearly, and the peasants were
sensible folks; but he was not understood, and could not
be understood by them for the same reason which prevented
the clerk from understanding him for a long time.
They were convinced that it was natural for every man
to look out for his own interest. And as to the land
owners, the experience of several generations had taught
them long ago that these were always serving their own
interests.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>"Well, what rate do you intend to assess," asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Why assess? We cannot do that? The land is
yours; it is for you to say," some in the crowd said.</p>

<p>"But understand that you are to use the money for the
common wants."</p>

<p>"We cannot do it. The community is one thing, and
this is another thing."</p>

<p>"You must understand," said the smiling clerk, wishing
to explain the offer, "that the Prince is giving you the land
for money which is to go into the community's treasury."</p>

<p>"We understand it very well," said a toothless old man
without raising his eyes. "Something like a bank, only
we must pay in time. We cannot do it; it is hard enough
as it is. That will ruin us entirely."</p>

<p>"That is to no purpose. We would rather continue as
before," said several dissatisfied and even rough voices.</p>

<p>The resistance was particularly hot when Nekhludoff
mentioned that he would draw a contract which he himself
and they would have to sign.</p>

<p>"What is the good of a contract? We will keep on
working as we did before. We don't care for it. We are
ignorant people."</p>

<p>"We cannot consent, because that is an uncustomary
thing. Let it be as it was before. If you would only do
away with the seed," several voices were heard.</p>

<p>"Doing away with the seed" meant that under the present
regime the sowing-seed was chargeable to the peasants,
and they asked that it be furnished by the master.</p>

<p>"So you refuse to take the land?" asked Nekhludoff,
turning to a middle-aged, bare-footed peasant in tattered
caftan and with a radiant face who held his cap straight
in front of him, like a soldier hearing "Hats off!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said this peasant.</p>

<p>"Then you have enough land?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the ex-soldier, with artificial cheerfulness,
holding his torn cap before him, as though offering
it to anyone deserving to take it.</p>

<p>"Think it over at your leisure," said the surprised Nekhludoff,
again repeating his offer.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to think over; as we said, so it will
be," the toothless, gloomy old man said angrily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>"I will stay here all day to-morrow. If you alter your
decision, let me know."</p>

<p>The peasants made no answer.</p>

<p>On their return to the office the clerk explained to Nekhludoff
that it was not a want of good sense that prevented
their acceptance of the offer; that when gathered in assembly
they always acted in that stubborn manner.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff then asked him to summon for the following
day several of the most intelligent peasants to whom
he would explain his project at greater length.</p>

<p>Immediately after the departure of the smiling clerk,
Nekhludoff heard angry women's voices interrupted by
the voice of the clerk. He listened.</p>

<p>"I have no more strength. You want the cross on my
breast," said an exasperated voice.</p>

<p>"She only ran in," said another voice. "Give her up, I
say. Why do you torture the beast, and keep the milk
from the children?"</p>

<p>Nekhludoff walked around the house where he saw two
disheveled women, one of whom was evidently pregnant,
standing near the staircase. On the stairs, with his hands
in the pockets of his crash overcoat, stood the clerk. Seeing
their master, the women became silent and began to
arrange their 'kerchiefs, which had fallen from their
heads, while the clerk took his hands out of his pockets
and began to smile.</p>

<p>The clerk explained that the peasants purposely permitted
their calves, and even cows, to roam over the master's
meadows. That two cows belonging to these women
had been caught on the meadow and driven into an inclosure.
The clerk demanded from the women thirty
copecks per cow, or two days' work.</p>

<p>"Time and again I told them," said the smiling clerk,
looking around at Nekhludoff, as if calling him to witness,
"to look out for cows when driving them to feed."</p>

<p>"I just went to see to the child, and they walked away."</p>

<p>"Don't leave them when you undertake to look after
them."</p>

<p>"And who would feed my child?"</p>

<p>"If they had only grazed, at least, they would have no
pains in their stomachs. But they only walked in."</p>

<p>"All the meadows are spoiled," the clerk turned to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>Nekhludoff.
"If they are not made to pay there will be no
hay left."</p>

<p>"Don't be sinning," cried the pregnant woman. "My
cow was never caught."</p>

<p>"But now that she was caught, pay for her, or work."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will work. But return me the cow; don't
torture her," she cried angrily. "It is bad enough as it is;
I get no rest, either day or night. Mother-in-law is sick;
my husband is drunk. Single-handed I have to do all the
work, and I have no strength. May you choke yourself!"
she shouted and began to weep.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff asked the clerk to release the cows and returned
to the house, wondering why people do not see
what is so plain.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-V" id="CHAPTER_2-V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Whether it was because there were fewer peasants present,
or because he was not occupied with himself, but with
the matter in hand, Nekhludoff felt no agitation when the
seven peasants chosen from the villagers responded to the
summons.</p>

<p>He first of all expressed his views on private ownership
of land.</p>

<p>"As I look upon it," he said, "land ought not to be the
subject of purchase and sale, for if land can be sold, then
those who have money will buy it all in and charge the
landless what they please for the use of it. People will
then be compelled to pay for the right to stand on the
earth," he added, quoting Spencer's argument.</p>

<p>"There remains to put on wings and fly," said an old
man with smiling eyes and gray beard.</p>

<p>"That's so," said a long-nosed peasant in a deep basso.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the ex-soldier.</p>

<p>"The old woman took some grass for the cow. They
caught her, and to jail she went," said a good-natured,
lame peasant.</p>

<p>"There is land for five miles around, but the rent is
higher than the land can produce," said the toothless, angry
old man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>"I am of the same opinion as you," said Nekhludoff,
"and that is the reason I want to give you the land."</p>

<p>"Well, that would be a kind deed," said a broad-shouldered
old peasant with a curly, grayish beard like that of
Michael Angelo's Moses, evidently thinking that Nekhludoff
intended to rent out the land.</p>

<p>"That is why I came here. I do not wish to own the
land any longer, but it is necessary to consider how to
dispose of it."</p>

<p>"You give it to the peasants&mdash;that's all," said the toothless,
angry peasant.</p>

<p>For a moment Nekhludoff was confused, seeing in these
words doubt of the sincerity of his purpose. But he
shook it off, and took advantage of the remark to say what
he intended.</p>

<p>"I would be only too glad to give it," he said, "but to
whom and how shall I give it? Why should I give it to
your community rather than to the Deminsky community?"
Deminsky was a neighboring village with very
little land.</p>

<p>They were all silent. Only the ex-soldier said, "Yes,
sir."</p>

<p>"And now tell me how would you distribute the land?"</p>

<p>"How? We would give each an equal share," said an
oven-builder, rapidly raising and lowering his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"How else? Of course divide it equally," said a good-natured,
lame peasant, whose feet, instead of socks, were
wound in a white strip of linen.</p>

<p>This decision was acquiesced in by all as being satisfactory.</p>

<p>"But how?" asked Nekhludoff, "are the domestics also
to receive equal shares?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the ex-soldier, assuming a cheerful
mood. But the sober-minded tall peasant disagreed with
him.</p>

<p>"If it is to be divided, everybody is to get an equal
share," after considering awhile, he said in a deep basso.</p>

<p>"That is impossible," said Nekhludoff, who was already
prepared with his objection. "If everyone was to get an
equal share, then those who do not themselves work would
sell their shares to the rich. Thus the land would again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>get into the hands of the rich. Again, the people that
worked their own shares would multiply, and the landlords
would again get the landless into their power."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the ex-soldier hastily assented.</p>

<p>"The selling of land should be prohibited; only those
that cultivate it themselves should be allowed to own it,"
said the oven-builder, angrily interrupting the soldier.</p>

<p>To this Nekhludoff answered that it would be difficult
to determine whether one cultivated the land for himself
or for others.</p>

<p>Then the sober-minded old man suggested that the land
should be given to them as an association, and that only
those that took part in cultivating it should get their share.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff was ready with arguments against this communistic
scheme, and he retorted that in such case it would
be necessary that all should have plows, that each should
have the same number of horses, and that none should lag
behind, or that everything should belong to society, for
which the consent of every one was necessary.</p>

<p>"Our people will never agree," said the angry old man.</p>

<p>"There will be incessant fighting among them," said the
white-bearded peasant with the shining eyes. "The
women will scratch each other's eyes out."</p>

<p>"The next important question is," said Nekhludoff,
"how to divide the land according to quality. You cannot
give black soil to some and clay and sand to others."</p>

<p>"Let each have a part of both," said the oven-builder.</p>

<p>To this Nekhludoff answered that it was not a question
of dividing the land in one community, but of the division
of land generally among all the communities. If the land
is to be given gratis to the peasants, then why should some
get good land, and others poor land? There would be a
rush for the good land.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the ex-soldier.</p>

<p>The others were silent.</p>

<p>"You see, it is not as simple as it appears at first sight,"
said Nekhludoff. "We are not the only ones, there are
other people thinking of the same thing. And now, there
is an American, named George, who devised the following
scheme, and I agree with him."</p>

<p>"What is that to you? You are the master; you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>distribute
the land, and there is an end to it," said the angry
peasant.</p>

<p>This interruption somewhat confused Nekhludoff, but
he was glad to see that others were also dissatisfied with
this interruption.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Uncle Semen; let him finish," said the old
man in an impressive basso.</p>

<p>This encouraged Nekhludoff, and he proceeded to explain
the single-tax theory of Henry George.</p>

<p>"The land belongs to no one&mdash;it belongs to the Creator."</p>

<p>"That's so!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"The land belongs to all in common. Every one has
an equal right to it. But there is good land, and there is
poor land. And the question is, how to divide the land
equally. The answer to this is, that those who own the
better land should pay to those who own the poorer the
value of the better land. But as it is difficult to determine
how much anyone should pay, and to whom, and as
society needs money for common utilities, let every land
owner pay to society the full value of his land&mdash;less, if it
is poorer; more, if it is better. And those who do not wish
to own land will have their taxes paid by the land
owners."</p>

<p>"That's correct," said the oven-builder. "Let the
owner of the better land pay more."</p>

<p>"What a head that Jhorga had on him!" said the portly
old peasant with the curls.</p>

<p>"If only the payments were reasonable," said the tall
peasant, evidently understanding what it was leading to.</p>

<p>"The payments should be such that it would be neither
too cheap nor too dear. If too dear, it would be unprofitable;
if too cheap, people would begin to deal in land.
This is the arrangement I would like you to make."</p>

<p>Voices of approval showed that the peasants understood
him perfectly.</p>

<p>"What a head!" repeated the broad-shouldered peasant
with the curls, meaning "Jhorga."</p>

<p>"And what if I should choose to take land?" said the
clerk, smiling.</p>

<p>"If there is an unoccupied section, take and cultivate
it," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>"What do you want land for? You are not hungering
without land," said the old man with the smiling eyes.</p>

<p>Here the conference ended.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff repeated his offer, telling the peasants to
consult the wish of the community, before giving their
answer.</p>

<p>The peasants said that they would do so, took leave of
Nekhludoff and departed in a state of excitement. For
a long time their loud voices were heard, and finally died
away about midnight.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The peasants did not work the following day, but discussed
their master's proposition. The community was
divided into two factions. One declared the proposition
profitable and safe; the other saw in the proposition a plot
which it feared the more because it could not understand
it. On the third day, however, the proposition was accepted,
the fears of the peasants having been allayed by
an old woman who explained the master's action by the
suggestion that he began to think of saving his soul. This
explanation was confirmed by the large amount of money
Nekhludoff had distributed while he remained in Panov.
These money gifts were called forth by the fact that here,
for the first time, he learned to what poverty the peasants
had been reduced and though he knew that it was unwise,
he could not help distributing such money as he had,
which was considerable.</p>

<p>As soon as it became known that the master was distributing
money, large crowds of people from the entire
surrounding country came to him asking to be helped.
He had no means of determining the respective needs of
the individuals, and yet he could not help giving these evidently
poor people money. Again, to distribute money
indiscriminately was absurd. His only way out of the
difficulty was to depart, which he hastened to do.</p>

<p>On the third day of his visit to Panov, Nekhludoff,
while looking over the things in the house, in one of the
drawers of his aunt's chiffonnier, found a picture representing
a group of Sophia Ivanovna, Catherine Ivanovna,
himself, as student, and Katiousha&mdash;neat, fresh,
beautiful and full of life. Of all the things in the house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>Nekhludoff removed this picture and the letters. The
rest he sold to the miller for a tenth part of its value.</p>

<p>Recalling now the feeling of pity over the loss of his
property which he had experienced in <a name="Kusminskoie" id="Kusminskoie"></a>Kusminskoie, Nekhludoff
wondered how he could have done so. Now he
experienced the gladness of release and the feeling of
novelty akin to that experienced by an explorer who discovers
new lands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-VI" id="CHAPTER_2-VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>It was evening when Nekhludoff arrived in the city,
and as he drove through the gas-lit streets to his house,
it looked to him like a new city. The odor of camphor
still hung in the air through all the rooms, and Agrippina,
Petrovna and <a name="Kornei" id="Kornei"></a>Kornei seemed tired out and dissatisfied, and
even quarreled about the packing of the things, the use
of which seemed to consist chiefly in being hung out, dried
and packed away again. His room was not occupied, but
was not arranged for his coming, and the trunks blocked
all the passages, so that his coming interfered with those
affairs which, by some strange inertia, were taking place
in this house. This evident foolishness, to which he had
once been a party, seemed so unpleasant to Nekhludoff,
after the impressions he had gained of the want in the villages,
that he decided to move to a hotel the very next
day, leaving the packing to Agrippina until the arrival of
his sister.</p>

<p>He left the house in the morning, hired two modest and
not over-clean furnished rooms near the prison, and went
to his lawyer.</p>

<p>After the storms and rains came those cold, piercing
winds that usually occur in the fall. Protected only by a
light overcoat, Nekhludoff was chilled to the bone. He
walked quickly in order to warm himself.</p>

<p>The village scenes came to his mind&mdash;the women, children
and old men, whose poverty and exhaustion he had
noticed as if for the first time, especially that oldish child
which twisted its little calfless legs&mdash;and he involuntarily
compared them with the city folks. Passing by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>butcher, fish and clothing shops, he was struck, as if it was
the first time he looked upon them&mdash;by the physical evidences
of the well-being of such a large number of clean,
well-fed shopkeepers which was not to be seen anywhere
in the villages. Equally well fed were the drivers in
quilted coats and buttons on their backs, porters, servant
girls, etc. In all these people he now involuntarily saw
those same village folks whom privation had driven to the
city. Some of them were able to take advantage of the
conditions in the city and became happy proprietors themselves;
others were reduced to even greater straits and
became even more wretched. Such wretchedness Nekhludoff
saw in a number of shoemakers that he saw working
near the window of a basement; in the lean, pale, disheveled
washerwomen ironing with bare hands before
open windows from which soap-laden steam poured out;
in two painters, aproned and bare-footed, who were covered
with paint from temple to heel. In their sunburnt,
sinewy, weak hands, bared above the elbows, they carried
a bucket of paint and incessantly cursed each other.
Their faces were wearied and angry. The same expression
of weariness and anger he saw in the dusty faces of
the truck drivers; on the swollen and tattered men,
women and children who stood begging on the street corners.
Similar faces were seen in the windows of the tea-houses
which Nekhludoff passed. Around the dirty
tables, loaded with bottles and tea services, perspiring
men with red, stupefied faces sat shouting and singing,
and white-aproned servants flitted to and fro.</p>

<p>"Why have they all gathered here?" thought Nekhludoff,
involuntarily inhaling, together with the dust, the
odor of rancid oil spread by the fresh paint.</p>

<p>On one of the streets he suddenly heard his name
called above the rattling of the trucks. It was Shenbok,
with curled and stiffened mustache and radiant face.
Nekhludoff had lost sight of him long ago, but heard
that on leaving his regiment and joining the cavalry, notwithstanding
his debts he managed to hold his own in
rich society.</p>

<p>"I am glad I met you. There is not a soul in the city.
How old you have grown, my boy! I only recognized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>you by your walk. Well, shall we have dinner together?
Where can we get a good meal here?"</p>

<p>"I hardly think I will have the time," answered Nekhludoff,
who wished to get rid of his friend without offending
him. "What brings you here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Business, my boy. Guardianship affairs. I am a
guardian, you know. I have charge of Samanoff's business&mdash;the
rich Samanoff, you know. He is a spendthrift,
and there are fifty-four thousand acres of land!" he said
with particular pride, as if he had himself made all these
acres. "The affairs were fearfully neglected. The land
was rented to the peasants, who did not pay anything and
were eighty thousand rubles in arrears. In one year I
changed everything, and realized seventy per cent. more
for the estate. Eh?" he asked, with pride.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff recalled a rumor that for the very reason
that Shenbok squandered his own wealth and was inextricably
in debt, he was appointed guardian over a rich
old spendthrift, and was now evidently obtaining an income
from the guardianship.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff refused to take dinner with Shenbok, or
accompany him to the horse races, to which the latter
invited him, and after an exchange of commonplaces the
two parted.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that I was like him?" thought Nekhludoff.
"Not exactly, but I sought to be like him, and
thought that I would thus pass my life."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The lawyer received him immediately on his arrival,
although it was not his turn. The lawyer expressed himself
strongly on the detention of the Menshovs, declaring
that there was not a particle of evidence against them on
record.</p>

<p>"If the case is tried here, and not in the district, I will
stake anything on their discharge. And the petition in
behalf of Theodosia Brinkova is ready. You had better
take it with you to St. Petersburg and present it there.
Otherwise there will begin an inquiry which will have no
end. Try to reach some people who have influence with
the commission on petitions. Well, that's all, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No. Here they write me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You seem to be the funnel into which all the prison
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>complaints are poured. I fear you will not hold them
all."</p>

<p>"But this case is simply shocking," said Nekhludoff,
and related the substance of it.</p>

<p>"What is it that surprises you?"</p>

<p>"Everything. I can understand the orderly who acted
under orders, but the assistant prosecutor who drew the
indictment is an educated man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is the mistake. We are used to think that the
prosecuting officers&mdash;the court officers generally&mdash;are a
kind of new, liberal men. And so they were at one time,
but not now. The only thing that concerns these officers
is to draw their salaries on the 20th of every month.
Their principles begin and end with their desire to get
more. They will arrest, try and convict anybody&mdash;&mdash;. I am
always telling these court officers that I never look
upon them without gratitude," continued the lawyer, "because
it is due to their kindness that I, you and all of us
are not in jail. To deprive any one of us of all civil
rights and send him to Siberia is the easiest thing imaginable."</p>

<p>"But if everything depends on the pleasure of the prosecutor,
who can enforce the law or not, then what is the
use of the courts?"</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"That is the question you are raising. Well, my dear
sir, that is philosophy. However, we can discuss that.
Come to my house next Saturday. You will find there
scholars, litterateurs, artists. We will have a talk on social
questions," said the lawyer, pronouncing the words
"social questions" with ironical pathos. "Are you acquainted
with my wife? Call on Saturday."</p>

<p>"I will try," answered Nekhludoff, feeling that he was
saying an untruth; that if there was anything he would
try hard to do it was not to be present at the lawyer's
amid the scholars, litterateurs and artists.</p>

<p>The laughter with which the lawyer met Nekhludoff's
remark concerning the uselessness of courts if the prosecutors
can do what they please, and the intonation with
which he pronounced the words "philosophy" and "social
questions," showed how utterly unlike himself were the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>lawyer and the people of his circle, both in character and
in views of life.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-VII" id="CHAPTER_2-VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>It was late and the distance to the prison was long, so
Nekhludoff hired a trap. On one of the streets the driver,
who was a middle-aged man with an intelligent and good-natured
face, turned to Nekhludoff and pointed to an immense
building going up.</p>

<p>"What a huge building there is going up!" he said with
pride, as if he had a part in the building of it.</p>

<p>It was really a huge structure, built in a complex, unusual
style. A scaffolding of heavy pine logs surrounded
the structure, which was fenced in by deal boards. It
was as busy a scene as an ant hill.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff wondered that these people, while their
wives were killing themselves with work at home, and
their children starving, should think it necessary to build
that foolish and unnecessary house for some foolish and
unnecessary man.</p>

<p>"Yes, a foolish building," he spoke his thought aloud.</p>

<p>"How foolish?" retorted the offended driver. "Thanks
to them, the people get work. It is not foolish."</p>

<p>"But the work is unnecessary."</p>

<p>"It must be necessary if they are building it," said the
driver. "It gives the people food."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff became silent, the more so because it was
too noisy to be heard. When they had reached the macadamized
road near the prison the driver again turned to
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"And what a lot of people are coming to the city&mdash;awful,"
he said, turning around on the box and pointing
to a party of laborers with saws, axes, coats and sacks
thrown over their shoulders, and coming from the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>"More than in former years?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"No comparison. The masters are kicking them about
like shavings. The market places are glutted with them."</p>

<p>"What is the reason?"</p>

<p>"They have multiplied. They have no homes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>"And what if they have multiplied! Why do they not
remain in the villages?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to do there. There is no land."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff experienced that which happens with a sore
place&mdash;it is struck oftener than any other part of the body.
But it only seems so because it is more noticeable.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible that it is everywhere the same?"
he thought, and asked the driver how much land there
was in his village; how much he himself owned, and why
he lived in the city.</p>

<p>"There is but an acre to every person. We are renting
three acres. There is my father and brother. Another
brother is in the army. They are managing it. But there
is really nothing to manage, and my brother intended to
go to Moskow."</p>

<p>"Is there no land for rent?"</p>

<p>"Where could one get land nowadays? The masters'
children have squandered theirs. The merchants have
it all in their hands. One cannot rent it from them; they
cultivate it themselves. Our lands are held by a Frenchman
who bought them of the former landlord. He won't
rent any of it, and that is all."</p>

<p>"What Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"Dufar, the Frenchman&mdash;you may have heard. He is
making wigs for the actors. He is now our master, and
does what he pleases with us. He is a good man himself,
but his wife is Russian&mdash;and what a cur! She is robbing
the people&mdash;simply awful! But here is the prison. Shall
I drive up to the front? I think they don't admit through
the front."</p>

<p>With a faint heart and with horror at the thought that
he might find Maslova in an inebriate condition and persistently
antagonistic, and at the mystery which she was
to him, Nekhludoff rang the bell and inquired of the inspector
about Maslova. She was in the hospital.</p>

<p>A young physician, impregnated with carbolic acid,
came out into the corridor and sternly asked Nekhludoff
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>what he wanted. The physician indulged the prisoners'
shortcomings and often relaxed the rules in their favor,
for which he often ran afoul of the prison officials and
even the head physician. Fearing that Nekhludoff might
ask something not permitted by the rules, and, moreover,
desiring to show that he made no exceptions in favor of
anybody, he feigned anger.</p>

<p>"There are no women here; this is the children's ward,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I know it, but there is a nurse here who had been
transferred from the prison."</p>

<p>"Yes, there are two. What do you wish, then?"</p>

<p>"I am closely related to one of them, Maslova," said
Nekhludoff, "and would like to see her. I am going to
St. Petersburg to enter an appeal in her case. I would
like to hand her this; it is only a photograph," and he
produced an envelope from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may do that," said the softened physician,
and turning to an old nurse in a white apron, told her to
call Maslova. "Won't you take a seat, or come into the
reception-room?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Nekhludoff, and taking advantage of
the favorable change in the physician's demeanor, asked
him what they thought of Maslova in the hospital.</p>

<p>"Her work is fair, considering the conditions amid
which she had lived," answered the physician. "But there
she comes."</p>

<p>The old nurse appeared at one of the doors, and behind
her came Maslova. She wore a white apron over a
striped skirt; a white cap on her head hid her hair. Seeing
Nekhludoff she flushed, stopped waveringly, then
frowned, and with downcast eyes approached him with
quick step. Coming near him she stood for a moment
without offering her hand, then she did offer her hand
and became even more flushed. Nekhludoff had not seen
her since the conversation in which she excused herself
for her impetuosity, and he expected to find her in a
similar mood. But she was entirely different to-day;
there was something new in the expression of her face;
something timid and reserved, and, as it seemed to him,
malevolent toward him. He repeated the words he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>said to the physician and handed her the envelope with the
photograph which he had brought from Panov.</p>

<p>"It is an old picture which I came across in Panov. It
may please you to have it. Take it."</p>

<p>Raising her black eyebrows she looked at him with her
squinting eyes, as though asking, "What is that for?"
Then she silently took the envelope and tucked it under
her apron.</p>

<p>"I saw your aunt there," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Did you?" she said, with indifference.</p>

<p>"How do you fare here?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Fairly well," she said.</p>

<p>"It is not very hard?"</p>

<p>"Not very. I am not used to it yet."</p>

<p>"I am very glad. At any rate, it is better than there."</p>

<p>"Than where?" she said, and her face became purple.</p>

<p>"There, in the prison," Nekhludoff hastened to say.</p>

<p>"Why better?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I think the people here are better. There are no such
people here as there."</p>

<p>"There are many good people there."</p>

<p>"I did what I could for the Menshovs and hope they
will be freed," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"May God grant it. Such a wonderful little woman,"
she said, repeating her description of the old woman, and
slightly smiled.</p>

<p>"I am going to-day to St. Petersburg. Your case will
be heard soon, and, I hope, will be reversed."</p>

<p>"It is all the same now, whether they reverse it or not,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Why now?"</p>

<p>"So," she answered, and stealthily glanced at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff understood this answer and this glance as
a desire on her part to know if he were still holding to
his decision, or had changed it since her refusal.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it is all the same to you," he said,
"but to me it really is all the same whether you are acquitted
or not. In either case, I am ready to do what I
said," he said, with determination.</p>

<p>She raised her head, and her black, squinting eyes fixed
themselves on his face and past it, and her whole face <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>became
radiant with joy. But her words were in an entirely
different strain.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't talk that way," she said.</p>

<p>"I say it that you may know."</p>

<p>"Everything has been already said, and there is no use
talking any more," she said, with difficulty repressing a
smile.</p>

<p>There was some noise in the ward. A child was heard
crying.</p>

<p>"I think I am called," she said, looking around with
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Well, then, good-by," he said.</p>

<p>She pretended not to see his extended hand, turned
round, and endeavoring to hide her elation, she walked
away with quick step.</p>

<p>"What is taking place in her? What is she thinking?
What are her feelings? Is she putting me to a test, or is
she really unable to forgive me? Can she not say what
she thinks and feels, or simply will not? Is she pacified
or angered?" Nekhludoff asked himself, but could give no
answer. One thing he knew, however, and that was that
she had changed; that a spiritual transformation was taking
place in her, and this transformation united him not
only to her, but to Him in whose name it was taking
place. And this union caused him joyful agitation.</p>

<p>Returning to the ward where eight children lay in their
beds, Maslova began to remake one of the beds, by order
of the Sister, and, leaning over too far with the sheet,
slipped and nearly fell. The convalescing boy, wound in
bandages to his neck, began to laugh. Maslova could restrain
herself no longer, and seating herself on the bedstead
she burst into loud laughter, infecting several children,
who also began to laugh. The Sister angrily
shouted:</p>

<p>"What are you roaring about? Think you this is like
the place you came from? Go fetch the rations."</p>

<p>Maslova stopped laughing, and taking a dish went on
her errand, but exchanging looks with the bandaged boy,
who giggled again.</p>

<p>Several times during the day, when Maslova remained
alone, she drew out a corner of the picture and looked at
it with admiration, but in the evening, when she and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>another
nurse retired for the night, she removed the picture
from the envelope and immovably looked with admiration
at the faces; her own, his and the aunt's, their dresses,
the stairs of the balcony, the bushes in the background,
her eyes feasting especially on herself, her young, beautiful
face with the hair hanging over her forehead. She
was so absorbed that she failed to notice that the other
nurse had entered.</p>

<p>"What is that? Did he give it you?" asked the stout,
good-natured nurse, leaning over the photograph.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that that is you?"</p>

<p>"Who else?" Maslova said, smiling and looking into
her companion's face.</p>

<p>"And who is that? He himself? And that is his
mother?"</p>

<p>"His aunt. Couldn't you recognize me?" asked Maslova.</p>

<p>"Why, no. I could never recognize you. The face is
entirely different. That must have been taken about ten
years ago."</p>

<p>"Not years, but a lifetime," said Maslova, and suddenly
her face became sullen and a wrinkle formed between her
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yours was an easy life, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, easy," Maslova repeated, closing her eyes and
shaking her head. "Worse than penal servitude."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because. From eight in the evening to four in the
morning&mdash;every day the same."</p>

<p>"Then why don't they get out?"</p>

<p>"They like to, but cannot. But what is the use of
talking!" cried Maslova, and she sprang to her feet, threw
the photograph into the drawer of the table, and suppressing
her angry tears, ran into the corridor, slamming the
door. Looking on the photograph she imagined herself
as she had been at the time the photograph was made,
and dreamed how happy she had been and might still be
with him. The words of her companion reminded her
what she was now&mdash;reminded her of all the horror of that
life which she then felt but confusedly, and would not
allow herself to admit. Only now she vividly recalled all
those terrible nights, particularly one Shrovetide night.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>She recalled how she, in a low-cut, wine-bespattered, red
silk dress, with a red bow in her dishevelled hair, weak,
jaded and tipsy, after dancing attendance upon the guest,
had seated herself, at two in the morning, near the thin,
bony, pimpled girl-pianist and complained of her hard
life. The girl said that her life was also disagreeable to
her, and that she wished to change her occupation. Afterward
their friend Clara joined them, and all three suddenly
decided to change their life. They were about to
leave the place when the drunken guests became noisy,
the fiddler struck up a lively song of the first figure of
a Russian quadrille, the pianist began to thump in unison,
a little drunken man in a white necktie and dress coat
caught her up. Another man, stout and bearded, and also
in a dress coat, seized Clara, and for a long time they
whirled, danced, shouted and drank. Thus a year passed,
a second and a third. How could she help changing!
And the cause of it all was he. And suddenly her former
wrath against him rose in her; and she felt like chiding
and reproving him. She was sorry that she had missed
the opportunity of telling him again that she knew him,
and would not yield to him; that she would not allow him
to take advantage of her spiritually as he had done corporeally;
that she would not allow him to make her the
subject of his magnanimity. And in order to deaden the
painful feeling of pity for herself and the useless reprobation
of him, she yearned for wine. And she would
have broken her word and drunk some wine had she been
in the prison. But here wine could only be obtained from
the assistant surgeon, and she was afraid of him, because
he pursued her with his attentions, and all relations with
men were disgusting to her. For some time she sat on
a bench in the corridor, and returning to her closet,
without heeding her companion's questions, she wept for
a long time over her ruined life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-IX" id="CHAPTER_2-IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff had four cases in hand: Maslova's appeal,
the petition of Theodosia Birukova, the case of Shustova's
release, by request of Vera Bogodukhovskaia, and the
obtaining of permission for a mother to visit her son
kept in a fortress, also by Bogodukhovskaia's request.</p>

<p>Since his visit to Maslenikoff, especially since his trip
to the country, Nekhludoff felt an aversion for that sphere
in which he had been living heretofore, and in which the
sufferings borne by millions of people in order to secure
the comforts and pleasures of a few, were so carefully
concealed that the people of that sphere did not and could
not see these sufferings, and consequently the cruelty and
criminality of their own lives.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff could no longer keep up relations with these
people without reproving himself. And yet the habits of
his past life, the ties of friendship and kinship, and especially
his one great aim of helping Maslova and the other
unfortunates, drew him into that sphere against his will;
and he was compelled to ask the aid and services of people
whom he had not only ceased to respect but who called
forth his indignation and contempt.</p>

<p>Arriving at St. Petersburg, and stopping at his aunt's,
the wife of an ex-Minister of State, he found himself in
the very heart of the aristocratic circle. It was unpleasant
to him, but he could do no different. Not to stop at
his aunt's was to offend her. Besides, through her connections
she could be of great service to him in those
affairs for the sake of which he came to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>"What wonders I hear about you!" said Countess Catherine
Ivanovna Charskaia, while Nekhludoff was drinking
the coffee brought him immediately after his arrival.
"Vous posez pour un Howard. You are helping the
convicts; making the rounds of the prisons; reforming
them."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken; I never had such intentions."</p>

<p>"Why, that is not bad. Only, I understand, there is
some love affair&mdash;come, tell me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>Nekhludoff related the story of Maslova, exactly as it
happened.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember. Poor Hellen told me at the time
you lived at the old maids' house that, I believe, they
wished you to marry their ward." Countess Catherine
Ivanovna always hated Nekhludoff's aunts on his father's
side. "So, that is she? Elle est encore jolie?"</p>

<p>Aunt Catherine Ivanovna was a sixty-year-old, healthy,
jolly, energetic, talkative woman. She was tall, very
stout, with a black, downy mustache on her upper lip.
Nekhludoff loved her, and since childhood had been accustomed
to get infected with her energy and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"No, ma tante, all that belongs to the past. I only wish
to help her, because she is innocent, and it is my fault
that she was condemned, her whole wrecked life is upon
my conscience. I feel it to be my duty to do for her what
I can."</p>

<p>"But how is it? I was told that you wish to marry
her."</p>

<p>"I do wish it, it is true; but she doesn't."</p>

<p>Catherine Ivanovna raised her eyebrows and silently
looked at Nekhludoff in surprise. Suddenly her face
changed and assumed a pleased expression.</p>

<p>"Well, she is wiser than you are. Ah! what a fool you
are! And you would marry her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"After what she has been?"</p>

<p>"The more so&mdash;is it not all my fault?"</p>

<p>"Well, you are simply a crank," said the aunt, suppressing
a smile. "You are an awful crank, but I love you for
the very reason that you are such an awful crank," she
repeated, the word evidently well describing, according to
her view, the mental and moral condition of her nephew.
"And how opportune. You know, Aline has organized a
wonderful asylum for Magdalens. I visited it once.
How disgusting they are! I afterward washed myself
from head to foot. But Aline is corps et ame in this
affair. So we will send her, your Magdalen, to her. If
any one will reform her, it is Aline."</p>

<p>"But she was sentenced to penal servitude. I came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>here for the express purpose of obtaining a reversal of
her sentence. That is my first business to you."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Where is the case now?"</p>

<p>"In the Senate."</p>

<p>"In the Senate? Why, my dear cousin Levoushka is
in the Senate. However, he is in the Heraldry Department.
Let me see. No, of the real ones I do not know
any. Heaven knows what a mixture they are: either
Germans, such as Ge, Fe, De&mdash;tout l'alphabet&mdash;or all sorts
of Ivanvas, Semenovs, Nikitins, or Ivaneukos, Semeneukos,
Nikitenkas pour varier. Des gens de l'autre monde.
However, I will tell my husband. He knows all sorts of
people. I will tell him. You explain it to him, for he
never understands me. No matter what I may say, he always
says that he cannot understand me. C'est un parti
pris. Everybody understands, only he does not understand."</p>

<p>At that moment a servant in knee-breeches entered with
a letter on a silver tray.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is from Aline. Now you will have an opportunity
to hear Kisiweather."</p>

<p>"Who is that Kisiweather?"</p>

<p>"Kisiweather? Come around to-day and you will find
out who he is. He speaks so that the most hardened
criminals fall on their knees and weep, and repent."</p>

<p>Countess Catherine Ivanovna, however strange it might
be, and how so little it agreed with her character, was a
follower of that teaching which held that essence of
Christianity consisted in a belief in redemption. She visited
the meetings where sermons were delivered on this
teaching then in vogue, and invited the adherents to her
own house. Although this teaching rejected all rites,
images and even the sacraments, the Princess had images
hanging in all her rooms, even over her bedstead, and she
complied with all the ritual requirements of the church,
seeing nothing contradictory in that.</p>

<p>"Your Magdalen ought to hear him; she would become
converted," said the Countess. "Don't fail to come to-night.
You will hear him then. He is a remarkable
man."</p>

<p>"It is not interesting to me, ma tante."</p>

<p>"I tell you it is interesting. You must come to-night.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>Now, what else do you want me to do? Videz votre
sac."</p>

<p>"There is the man in the fortress."</p>

<p>"In the fortress? Well, I can give you a note to Baron
Kriegmuth. C'est un tr&egrave;s-brave homme. But you know
him yourself. He was your father's comrade. Il donne
<a name="dans" id="dans"></a>dans le spiritisme. But that is nothing. He is a kind
man. What do you want there?"</p>

<p>"It is necessary to obtain permission for a mother to
visit her son who is incarcerated there. But I was told
that Cherviansky and not Kriegmuth is the person to be
applied to."</p>

<p>"I do not like Cherviansky, but he is Mariette's husband.
I will ask her; she will do it for me. Elle est tres
gentille."</p>

<p>"There is another woman I wish you would speak to
her about. She has been in prison for several months,
and no one knows for what."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; she herself surely knows for what. They
know very well. And it serves them right, those short-haired
ones."</p>

<p>"I do not know whether it serves them right or not.
But they are suffering. You are a Christian, and believe
in the Gospel, and yet are so pitiless."</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it. The Gospel is one
thing; what I dislike is another thing. It would be worse
if I pretended to like the Nihilists, especially the female
Nihilists, when as a matter of fact I hate them."</p>

<p>"Why do you hate them?"</p>

<p>"Why do they meddle in other people's affairs? It is
not a woman's business."</p>

<p>"But you have nothing against Mariette occupying herself
with business," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Mariette? Mariette is Mariette, but who is she? A
conceited ignoramus who wants to teach everybody."</p>

<p>"They do not wish to teach; they only wish to help
the people."</p>

<p>"We know without them who should and who should
not be helped."</p>

<p>"But the people are impoverished. I have just been in
the country. Is it proper that peasants should overwork
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>themselves without getting enough to eat, while we are
living in such wasteful luxury?"</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do? You would like to see
me work and not eat anything?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not wish you not to eat," smiling involuntarily,
answered Nekhludoff. "I only wish that we should
all work, and all have enough to eat."</p>

<p>The aunt again raised her eyebrows and gazed at him
with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Mon cher, vous finirez mal," she said.</p>

<p>At that moment a tall, broad-shouldered general entered
the room. It was Countess Charskaia's husband, a
retired Minister of State.</p>

<p>"Ah, Dmitri, how do you do?" he said, putting out his
clean-shaven cheek. "When did you get here?"</p>

<p>He silently kissed his wife on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Non, il est impayable." Countess Catherine Ivanovna
turned to her husband. "He wants me to do washing
on the river and feast on potatoes. He is an awful fool,
but, nevertheless, do for him what he asks. An awful
crank," she corrected herself. "By the way, they say
that Kamenskaia is in a desperate condition; her life is
despaired of," she turned to her husband. "You ought
to visit her."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is awful," said the husband.</p>

<p>"Go, now, and have a talk together; I must write some
letters."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff had just reached the room next to the reception-room
when she shouted after him:</p>

<p>"Shall I write then to Mariette?"</p>

<p>"If you please, ma tante."</p>

<p>"I will learn that which you want to say about the
short-haired en blanc, and she will have her husband attend
to it. Don't think that I am angry. They are hateful,
your protegees, but&mdash;je ne leur veux pas de mal.
But God forgive them. Now, go, and don't forget to
come in the evening; you will hear Kisiweather. We will
also pray. And if you do not resist, ca vous fera beaucoup
de bien. I know that Hellen and all of you are
very backward in that respect. Now, au revoir."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-X" id="CHAPTER_2-X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>The man in whose power it was to lighten the condition
of the prisoners in St. Petersburg had earned a great
number of medals, which, except for a white cross in his
button-hole, he did not wear, however. The old general
was of the German barons, and, as it was said of him,
had become childish. He had served in the Caucasus,
where he had received this cross; then in Poland and in
some other place, and now he held the office which gave
him good quarters, maintenance and honor. He always
strictly carried out the orders of his superiors, and considered
their execution of great importance and significance,
so much so that while everything in the world could
be changed, these orders, according to him, were above
the possibility of any alteration.</p>

<p>As Nekhludoff was approaching the old general's
house the tower clock struck two. The general was at
the time sitting with a young artist in the darkened reception-room,
at a table, the top of which was of inlaid
work, both of them turning a saucer on a sheet of paper.
Holding each others fingers over the saucer, placed face
downward, they pulled in different directions over the
paper on which were printed all the letters of the alphabet.
The saucer was answering the general's question.
How would souls recognize each other after death?</p>

<p>At the moment one of the servants entered with Nekhludoff's
card, the soul of Jeanne D'Arc was speaking
through the saucer. The soul had already said, "They
will recognize each other," which was duly entered on a
sheet of paper. When the servant entered, the saucer,
stopping first on the letter p, then on the letter o, reached
the letter s and began to jerk one way and another. That
was because, as the general thought, the next letter was
to be l, that is to say, Jeanne D'Arc, according to his idea,
intended to say that souls would recognize each other
only after they had been purged of everything mundane,
or something to that effect, and that therefore the next letter
ought to be l (<i>posl, i.&nbsp;e.</i>, after); the artist, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>other hand, thought that the next letter would be v; that
the soul intended to say that souls would recognize each
other by the light&mdash;<i>posv</i> (<i>ietu</i>) that would issue from the
ethereal body of the souls. The general, gloomily knitting
his brow, gazed fixedly on the hands, and imagining that
the saucer moved itself, pulled it toward the letter l. The
young, anaemic artist, with his oily hair brushed behind
his ears, looked into the dark corner of the room, with his
blue, dull eyes, and nervously twitching his lips, pulled
toward the letter v. The general frowned at the interruption,
and, after a moment's silence, took the card, put
on his pince-nez and, groaning from pain in his loins,
rose to his full height, rubbing his benumbed fingers.</p>

<p>"Show him into the cabinet."</p>

<p>"Permit me, Your Excellency, to finish it myself," said
the artist, rising. "I feel a presence."</p>

<p>"Very well; finish it," said the general with austerity,
and went, with firm, long strides, into the cabinet.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said the general in a rough voice
to Nekhludoff, pointing to an arm-chair near the desk.
"How long have you been in St. Petersburg?"</p>

<p>Nekhludoff said that he had but lately arrived.</p>

<p>"Is your mother, the Princess, well?"</p>

<p>"My mother is dead."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon; I was very sorry. My son told me that
he had met you."</p>

<p>The general's son was making the same career as his
father, and was very proud of the business with which
he was entrusted.</p>

<p>"Why, I served with your father. We were friends,
comrades. Are you in service?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not."</p>

<p>The general disapprovingly shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have a request to make of you, general," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Very glad. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"If my request be out of season, please forgive me.
But I must state it."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"There is a man, Gurkevitch, kept in prison under your
jurisdiction. His mother asks to be permitted to visit
him, or, at least to send him books."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>The general expressed neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction
at Nekhludoff's request, but, inclining his head
to one side, seemed to reflect. As a matter of fact he was
not reflecting; Nekhludoff's question did not even interest
him, knowing very well that his answer would be
as the law requires. He was simply resting mentally
without thinking of anything.</p>

<p>"That is not in my discretion, you know," he said, having
rested awhile. "There is a law relating to visits, and
whatever that law permits, that is permitted. And as to
books, there is a library, and they are given such books
as are allowed."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he wants scientific books; he wishes to
study."</p>

<p>"Don't believe that." The general paused. "It is not
for study that they want them, but so, it is simply unrest."</p>

<p>"But their time must be occupied somehow?"</p>

<p>"They are always complaining," retorted the general.
"We know them."</p>

<p>He spoke of them in general as of some peculiar race
of people.</p>

<p>"They have such conveniences here as is seldom seen
in a prison," he continued.</p>

<p>And as though justifying himself, he began to recount
all the conveniences enjoyed by the prisoners in a manner
to make one believe that the chief aim of the institution
consisted in making it a pleasant place of abode.</p>

<p>"Formerly, it is true, the regulations were very harsh,
but now their condition is excellent. They get three
dishes, one of which is always of meat&mdash;chopped meat or
cutlet. Sundays they get a fourth dish&mdash;dessert. May
God grant that every Russian could feed so well."</p>

<p>The general, like all old men, evidently having committed
to memory the oft-repeated words, proceeded to
prove how exacting and ungrateful the prisoners were
by repeating what he had told many times before.</p>

<p>"They are furnished books on spiritual topics, also old
journals. We have a library of suitable books, but they
seldom read them. At first they appear to be interested,
and then it is found that the pages of all the new books
are barely half cut, and of the old ones there is no evidence
of any thumb-marks at all. We even tried," with a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>remote
semblance of a smile the general continued, "to put
a piece of paper between the pages, and it remained untouched.
Writing, too, is allowed. A slate is given
them, also a slate-pencil, so that they may write for diversion.
They can wipe it out and write again. And yet
they don't write. No, they become quiet very soon. At
first they are uneasy, but afterward they even grow stout
and become very quiet."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff listened to the hoarse, feeble voice; looked
on that fleshless body, those faded eyes under the gray
eyebrows, those sunken, shaved cheeks, supported by a
military collar, that white cross, and understood that to
argue and explain to him the meaning of those words
were futile. But, making another effort, he asked him
about the prisoner, Shustova, whose release, he had received
information, had been ordered, through the efforts
of Mariette.</p>

<p>"Shustova? Shustova&mdash;I don't remember them all by
name. There are so many of them," he said, evidently
reproving them for being so numerous. He rang the
bell and called for the secretary.</p>

<p>While a servant was going after the secretary he admonished
Nekhludoff to go into service, saying that the
country was in need of honest, noble men.</p>

<p>"I am old, and yet I am serving to the extent of my
ability."</p>

<p>The secretary came and reported that there were no
papers received relating to Shustova, who was still in
prison.</p>

<p>"As soon as we receive an order we release them the
very same day. We do not keep them; we do not particularly
value their presence," said the general, again
with a waggish smile, which had the effect only of making
his face wry.</p>

<p>"Good-by, my dear," he continued. "Don't be offended
for advising you, for I do so only because I love you.
Have nothing to do with the prisoners. You will never
find innocent people among them. They are the most immoral
set. We know them," he said, in a tone of voice
which did not permit the possibility of doubt. "You had
better take an office. The Emperor and the country need
honest people. What if I and such as you refused to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>serve? Who would be left? We are complaining of conditions,
but refuse to aid the government."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff sighed deeply, made a low bow, pressed the
bony hand condescendingly extended, and departed.</p>

<p>The general disapprovingly shook his head, and, rubbing
his loins, went to the reception-room, where the
artist awaited him with the answer of Jeanne D'Arc. The
general put on his pince-nez and read: "They will recognize
each other by the light issuing from the ethereal
bodies."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the general, approvingly, closing his eyes.
"But how will one recognize another when all have the
same light?" he asked, and again crossing his fingers with
those of the artist, seated himself at the table.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Nekhludoff's driver drove up to the gate.</p>

<p>"It is very dull here, sir," he said, turning to Nekhludoff.
"It was very tiresome, and I was about to drive
away."</p>

<p>"Yes, tiresome," assented Nekhludoff with a deep sigh,
resting his eyes on the clouds and the Neva, dotted with
variegated boats and steamers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XI" id="CHAPTER_2-XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>With a note from Prince Ivan Michaelovitch, Nekhludoff
went to Senator Wolf&mdash;un homme tr&egrave;s comme il
faut, as the Prince had described him.</p>

<p>Wolf had just breakfasted and, as usual, was smoking
a cigar, to aid his digestion, when Nekhludoff arrived.
Vladimir Vasilievitch Wolf was really un homme tr&egrave;s
comme il faut, and this quality he placed above all
else; from the height of it he looked upon all other people,
and could not help valuing this quality, because, thanks to
it, he had gained a brilliant career&mdash;the same career he
strove for; that is to say, through marriage he obtained
a fortune, which brought him a yearly income of eighteen
thousand rubles, and by his own efforts he obtained a
senatorship. He considered himself not only un homme
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>tr&egrave;s comme il faut, but a man of chivalric honesty. By
honesty he understood the refusal to take bribes from private
people. But to do everything in his power to obtain
all sorts of traveling expenses, rents and disbursements
he did not consider dishonest. Nor did he consider it
dishonest to rob his wife and sister-in-law of their fortunes.
On the contrary, he considered that a wise arrangement
of his family affairs.</p>

<p>The home circle of Vladimir Vasilievitch consisted of
his characterless wife, her sister, whose fortune he managed
to get into his own hands by selling her property
and depositing the money in his own name, and his gentle,
scared, homely daughter, who was leading a solitary, hard
life, and whose only diversion consisted in visiting the
religious meetings at Aline's and Countess Catherine
Ivanovna's.</p>

<p>The son of Vladimir Vasilievitch, a good-natured,
bearded boy of fifteen, who at that age had already commenced
to drink and lead a depraved life which lasted till
he was twenty years old, was driven from the house for
the reason that he did not pass examinations in any school,
and keeping bad company, and, running into debt, he had
compromised his father. The father paid once for his
son two hundred and thirty rubles, and paid six hundred
rubles a second time, but declared that that was the last
time, and if the son did not reform he would drive him
from the house and have nothing to do with him. Not
only did the son not reform, but contracted another debt
of a thousand rubles, and told his father that he did not
care if he was driven from the house, since life at home
was torture to him. Then Vladimir Vasilievitch told his
son that he could go where he pleased; that he was no
longer his son. Since then no one in the house dared to
speak of his son to him. And Vladimir Vasilievitch was
quite certain that he had arranged his family affairs in
the best possible manner.</p>

<p>Wolf, with a flattering and somewhat derisive smile&mdash;it
was an involuntary expression of his consciousness of
his comme il faut superiority&mdash;halted in his exercise long
enough to greet Nekhludoff and read the note.</p>

<p>"Please take a seat, but you must excuse me. If you
have no objection I will walk," he said, putting his hands
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>in the pockets of his jacket, and treading lightly up and
down the diagonal of the large cabinet, furnished in an
austere style. "Very glad to make your acquaintance,
and, of course, to please the Count Ivan Michaelovitch,"
emitting the fragrant, blue smoke, and carefully removing
the cigar from his mouth so as not to lose the ashes.</p>

<p>"I would like to ask you to hasten the hearing of the
appeal, because if the prisoner is to go to Siberia, it would
be desirable that she go as soon as possible," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, with the first steamer from Nijhni; I know,"
said Wolf, with his condescending smile, who always
knew everything in advance, whatever the subject mentioned
to him. "What is the name of the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Maslova."</p>

<p>Wolf walked to the table and looked into the papers.</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;Maslova. Very well; I will ask my
associates. We will hear the case Wednesday."</p>

<p>"May I wire my lawyer?"</p>

<p>"So you have a lawyer? What for? But if you wish
it, all right."</p>

<p>"The grounds of appeal may be insufficient," said
Nekhludoff, "but I think it may be seen from the case
that the sentence was the result of a misunderstanding."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; that may be so, but the Senate cannot enter
into the merits of the case," said Vladimir Vasilievitch,
sternly, glancing at the ashes of his cigar. "The Senate
only looks after the proper interpretation and application
of the law."</p>

<p>"This, I think, is an exceptional case."</p>

<p>"I know; I know. All cases are exceptional. We will
do what the law requires. That is all." The ashes were
still intact, but had already cracked and were in danger
of collapse. "And do you often visit St. Petersburg?"
asked Wolf, holding the cigar so that the ashes would
not fall. The ashes were unstable, however, and Wolf
carefully carried them to the ash-holder, into which they
were finally precipitated.</p>

<p>"What an awful catastrophe Kamensky met with," said
Wolf. "A fine young man, and an only son. Especially
the condition of the mother"&mdash;he went on repeating almost
word for word the story of a duel of which all St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>Petersburg was talking at the time. After a few more
words about Countess Catherine Ivanovna and her passion
for the new religious tendency which Vladimir Vasilievitch
neither praised nor condemned, but which, for un
homme tr&egrave;s comme il faut, was evidently superfluous, he
rang the bell.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff bowed himself out.</p>

<p>"If it is convenient for you, come to dinner," said Wolf,
extending his hand, "say on Wednesday. I will then give
you a definite answer."</p>

<p>It was already late, and Nekhludoff drove home, that
is, to his aunt's.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XII" id="CHAPTER_2-XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>Maslova's case was to be heard the following day, and
Nekhludoff went to the Senate. He met Fanirin at the
entrance to the magnificent Senate building, where several
carriages were already waiting. Walking up the
grand, solemn staircase to the second floor, the lawyer,
who was familiar with all the passages, turned into a
room to the left, on the door of which was carved the year
of the institution of the Code. The lawyer removed his
overcoat, remaining in his dress-coat and black tie on a
white bosom, and with cheerful self-confidence walked
into the next room. There were about fifteen spectators
present, among whom were a young woman in a pince-nez,
and a gray-haired lady. A gray-haired old man of
patriarchal mien, wearing a box-coat and gray trousers,
and attended by two men, attracted particular attention.
He crossed the room and entered a wardrobe.</p>

<p>An usher, a handsome man with red cheeks and in a
pompous uniform, approached Fanirin with a piece of
paper in his hand and asked him in what case he appeared.
Being told that in Maslova's case, the usher
made a note of something and went away. At that time
the door of the wardrobe opened and the patriarchal looking
old man came forth, no longer in the coat, but in a
brilliant uniform which made him resemble a bird. His
uniform evidently embarrassed the old man, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>walked into the room opposite the entrance with quicker
than his ordinary step.</p>

<p>Fanirin pointed him out to Nekhludoff as B&eacute;, "a most
honorable gentleman." The spectators, including Fanirin,
went into the next room and seated themselves behind
the grating on benches reserved for spectators. Only the
St. Petersburg lawyer took a seat behind a desk on the
other side of the grating.</p>

<p>The session room of the Senate was smaller than the
room of the Circuit Court, was furnished in simpler style,
only the table behind which the Senators sat was of crimson
plush instead of green cloth, bordered with gold
lace.</p>

<p>There were four Senators. The President, Nikitin,
with a closely shaved, narrow face and steel-gray eyes;
Wolf, with thin lips and small white hands, with which
he was turning over the papers before him; then Skovorodnikoff,
stout, massive and pock-marked, and a very
learned jurist, and finally, B&eacute;, the same partriarchal old
man, who was the last to arrive. Immediately behind the
Senators came the Chief Secretary and Associate Attorney
General. He was a young man of medium height,
shaved, lean, with a very dark face and black, sad eyes.
Nekhludoff recognized him, notwithstanding his strange
uniform and the fact that he had not seen him for about
six years, as one of his best friends during his student
life.</p>

<p>"Is the associate's name <a name="Silenin" id="Silenin"></a>Selenin?" he asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Yes, why?"</p>

<p>"I know him very well; he is an excellent man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a good associate of the Attorney General&mdash;very
sensible. It would have been well to see him," said
Fanirin.</p>

<p>"At all events, he will follow the dictates of his conscience,"
said Nekhludoff, remembering his close relations
with and friendship for Selenin, and the latter's
charming qualities of purity, honesty and good breeding,
in the best sense of the word.</p>

<p>The first case before the Senate was an appeal from the
decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgment
in favor of the publisher of a newspaper in a libel
suit brought against him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>Nekhludoff listened and tried to understand the arguments
in the case, but as in the Circuit Court, the chief
difficulty in understanding what was going on was found
in the fact that the discussion centered not on what appeared
naturally to be the main point, but on side issues.</p>

<p>The libel consisted in an article accusing the president
of a stock company of swindling. It seemed, then, that
the main point to consider was, whether or not the president
was guilty of swindling the stockholders, and what
was to be done to stop his swindling. But this was never
mentioned. The questions discussed were: Had the
publisher the legal right to print the article of its reporter?
What crime has he committed by printing it&mdash;defamation
or libel? And does defamation include libel,
or libel defamation? And a number of other things unintelligible
to ordinary people, including various laws and
decisions of some "General Department."</p>

<p>The only thing Nekhludoff did understand was that,
though Wolf had sternly suggested but yesterday that
the Senate could not consider the substance of a case, in
the case at bar he argued with evident partiality in favor
of reversing the judgment, and that Selenin, in spite of
his characteristic reserve, argued in favor of affirming the
judgment with unexpected fervor. The cause of Selenin's
ardor lay in the fact that he knew the president
of the stock company to be dishonest in money affairs,
while he accidentally learned that Wolf, almost on the eve
of the hearing of the case, had attended a sumptuous
dinner at the president's house. And now, when Wolf,
though with great caution, showed undoubted partiality,
Selenin became excited and expressed his opinion with
more nervousness than an ordinary case would justify.
Wolf was evidently offended by the speech; he twitched
nervously, changed color, made silent gestures of wonder,
and with an haughty air of being offended he departed
with the other Senators into the deliberation-room.</p>

<p>"What case are you interested in?" the usher again
asked Fanirin, as soon as the Senators had left the room.</p>

<p>"I have already told you that I am here in behalf of
Maslova."</p>

<p>"That is so. The case will be heard to-day. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>"You see, the case was to be argued without counsel,
so that the Senators would hardly consider it in open
session. But&mdash;I will announce&mdash;&mdash;" and he made a note
on the piece of paper.</p>

<p>The Senators really intended, after announcing their
decision in the libel case, to consider the other cases, including
Maslova's, while drinking their tea and smoking
cigarettes in the consultation-room.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XIII" id="CHAPTER_2-XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>As soon as the Senators seated themselves at the table
in the consultation-room, Wolf began to set forth in an
animated manner the grounds upon which he thought the
case ought to be reversed.</p>

<p>The President, always an ill-natured man, was in a
particularly bad humor to-day. While listening to the
case during the session he formed his opinion, and sat,
absorbed in his thoughts, without listening to Wolf.
These thoughts consisted in a recollection of what note
he had made the other day in his memoirs anent the appointment
of Velianoff to an important post which he
desired for himself. The President, Nikitin, quite sincerely
thought that the officials with whom his duties
brought him in contact were worthy of a place in history.
Having written an article the other day in which some
of these officials were vehemently denounced for interfering
with his plan to save Russia from ruin, as he
put it, but in reality for interfering with his getting a
larger salary than he was now getting, he was now thinking
that posterity would give an entirely new interpretation
to that incident.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," he said to Wolf, who was addressing
him, although he did not hear what Wolf said.</p>

<p>B&eacute; listened to Wolf with a sad face, drawing garlands
on a piece of paper which lay before him. B&eacute; was a
liberal of the deepest dye. He scarcely held to the traditions
of the sixties, and if he ever deviated from strict
impartiality, it was invariably in favor of liberality.
Thus, in this case, besides the consideration that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>complaining president of the stock company was an unclean
man, B&eacute; was in favor of affirming the judgment,
also because this charge of libel against a journalist was
a restriction on the freedom of the press. When Wolf
had finished his argument, B&eacute;, leaving the garland unfinished,
in a sad&mdash;it was sad for him to be obliged to
prove such truisms&mdash;soft, pleasant voice, convincingly
proved in a few simple words that the charge had no
foundation, and, again drooping his hoary head, continued
to complete the garland.</p>

<p>Skovorodnikoff, who was sitting opposite Wolf, continually
gathering with his thick fingers his beard and
mustache into his mouth, as soon as B&eacute; was through with
his argument, stopped chewing his beard, and, in a loud,
rasping voice, said that although the president of the
stock company was a villain, he should favor a reversal
if there were legal grounds to sustain it, but as there
were none, he joined in the opinion of Ivan Semenovitch
(B&eacute;), and he invariably rejoiced at this shot aimed at
Wolf. The President supported Skovorodnikoff's opinion,
and the judgment was confirmed.</p>

<p>Wolf was dissatisfied, especially because by this judgment
he seemed to stand convicted of arguing in bad
faith; but, feigning indifference, he opened his papers
in the next case, Maslova's, and began to peruse it attentively.
The other Senators in the meantime called
for tea, and began a talk about Kamensky's duel and his
death, which was then the subject of conversation
throughout the city.</p>

<p>The usher entered and announced the desire of the
lawyer and Nekhludoff to be present at the hearing of the
case.</p>

<p>"This case here," said Wolf, "is a whole romantic
story," and he related what he knew of Nekhludoff's relations
to Maslova.</p>

<p>After talking awhile of the story, smoking cigarettes
and finishing their tea, the Senators returned to the
session-room, announced their decision in the preceding
case, and began to consider Maslova's case.</p>

<p>Wolf very circumstantially set forth Maslova's appeal
from the sentence, and again not without partiality, but
with the evident desire to reverse the judgment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>"Have you anything to add?" the President asked
Fanirin.</p>

<p>Fanirin rose, and, projecting his broad, starched front,
with remarkable precision of expression began to discuss
the errors of the court below in the application of the
law on the six points raised, and permitted himself,
though briefly, to touch upon the merits of the case and
the crying injustice of the decision. By the tone of his
short but strong speech, he seemed to excuse himself,
to insist that the honorable Senators with their power
of penetration and judicial wisdom saw and understood
better than he, but that he was speaking only because
his duties demanded it. After Fanirin's speech there
seemed to be no doubt left that the Senate had to reverse
the judgment. When he was through, Fanirin smiled
triumphantly. Looking at his lawyer and seeing that
smile, Nekhludoff was convinced that the case was won.
But as he looked at the Senators Nekhludoff saw that
Fanirin alone was smiling and triumphant. The Senators
and Associate Attorney General were neither smiling
nor triumphant, but wore the air of people suffering from
ennui and saying: "Oh, we know these cases! You are
wasting your time." They were all evidently relieved
only when the lawyer had finished, and they were no
longer unnecessarily detained. After the speech the
President turned to Selenin, who plainly, briefly and accurately
expressed himself against a reversal. Then the
Senators arose and went to consult.</p>

<p>The Senators were divided. Wolf favored a reversal.
B&eacute;, who thoroughly understood the case, warmly argued
also in favor of a reversal, and in glowing terms pictured
the court scene and the misunderstanding of the jury.
Nikitin, who, as usual, stood for severity and for strict
formality, was against it. The whole case, then, depended
on Skovorodnikoff's vote. And his vote was thrown
against a reversal, principally for the reason that Nekhludoff's
determination to marry the girl on moral grounds
was extremely repugnant to him.</p>

<p>Skovorodnikoff was a materialist, a Darwinist, and
considered every manifestation of abstract morality, or,
worse still, piety, not only as contemptible and absurd but
as an affront to his person. All this bustle about a fallen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>girl, and the presence there in the Senate of her famous
counsel and Nekhludoff himself, was to him simply disgusting.
And, stuffing his mouth with his beard, and
making grimaces, he in a very natural manner pretended
to know nothing of the entire affair, except that the
grounds of appeal were insufficient, and therefore agreed
with the President to affirm the judgment.</p>

<p>The appeal was denied.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XIV" id="CHAPTER_2-XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>"It is awful!" said Nekhludoff to the lawyer, as they
entered the waiting-room. "In the plainest possible case
they cavil at idle forms. It is awful!"</p>

<p>"The case was spoiled at the trial," said Fanirin.</p>

<p>"Selenin, too, was against reversal. It is awful,
awful!" Nekhludoff continued to repeat. "What is to
be done now?"</p>

<p>"We will petition the Emperor. Head it yourself while
you are here. I will prepare the petition."</p>

<p>At that moment Wolf in his uniform and stars hung
on his breast entered the waiting-room and approached
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, my dear Prince, but the grounds were insufficient,"
he said, shrugging his narrow shoulders; and,
closing his eyes, he proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>After Wolf came Selenin, who had learned from the
Senators that Nekhludoff, his former friend, was present.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to meet you here," he said, approaching
Nekhludoff and smiling with his lips, while his eyes
remained sad.</p>

<p>"And I did not know that you were the Attorney
General."</p>

<p>"Associate," Selenin corrected him. "But what brought
you to the Senate?"</p>

<p>"I came here hoping to find justice, and to save an
innocent woman."</p>

<p>"What woman?"</p>

<p>"The case that has just been decided."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>"Oh, the Maslova case!" said Selenin. "An entirely
groundless appeal."</p>

<p>"The question is not of the appeal, but of the woman,
who is innocent and undergoing punishment."</p>

<p>Selenin sighed.</p>

<p>"Quite possible, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not merely possible, but certain."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I know because I was on the jury. I know wherein
we made the mistake."</p>

<p>Selenin became thoughtful.</p>

<p>"It should have been declared on the trial," he said.</p>

<p>"I did so."</p>

<p>"It should have been made part of the record. If that
had appeared in the appeal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Selenin, who was always busy, and did not mingle in
society, had evidently not heard of Nekhludoff's romance.
Nekhludoff, however, decided not to speak to him of his
relations to Maslova.</p>

<p>"But it is evident even now that the verdict was preposterous,"
he said.</p>

<p>"The Senate has no right to say so. If the Senate attempted
to interfere with the verdicts of the courts upon
its own view of the justness of the verdicts themselves,
there would be greater risks of justice being miscarried
than established," he said, recalling the preceding case.
"Besides, the verdicts of juries would lose their significance."</p>

<p>"I only know one thing, and that is that the woman is
entirely innocent, and the last hope of saving her from
an undeserved punishment is gone. The highest judicial
institution has affirmed what was absolutely unjust."</p>

<p>"It has not affirmed because it has not and could not
consider the merits of the case," said Selenin, blinking
his eyes. "You have probably stopped at your aunts,"
he added, evidently wishing to change the subject of conversation.
"I learned yesterday that you were in St. Petersburg.
Countess Catherine Ivanovna had invited
me and you to be present at the meeting of the English
preacher," said Selenin, smiling only with his lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was present, but left with disgust," Nekhludoff
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>said angrily, vexed at Selenin's leading away from the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Why should you be disgusted? At all events it is a
manifestation of religious feeling, although one-sided and
sectarian," said Selenin.</p>

<p>"It is such strange nonsense," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Well, no. The only strange thing here is that we
know so little of the teachings of our church that we
receive an exposition of its fundamental dogmas as a new
revelation," said Selenin, as though hastening to tell his
former friends his new views.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff gazed at Selenin with wonder. Selenin did
not lower his eyes, in which there was an expression not
only of sadness, but of ill-will.</p>

<p>"But we will discuss it later," said Selenin. "I am
coming," he turned to the usher who approached him
deferentially. "We must meet again," he added, sighing;
"but you can never be found. You will always find me at
home at seven. I live on Nadeghinskaia," and he mentioned
the number. "It is a long time since we met,"
he added, again smiling with his lips.</p>

<p>"I will come if I have the time," said Nekhludoff, feeling
that the man whom he had once loved was made
strange and incomprehensible to him, if not hostile, by
this short conversation.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As student Nekhludoff knew Selenin as a dutiful son,
a true friend, and, for his years, an educated, worldly
man, with great tact, always elegant and handsome, and
uncommonly truthful and honest withal. He studied diligently,
without any difficulty and without the slightest
ostentation, receiving gold medals for his compositions.</p>

<p>He had made it the aim of his young life, not merely
by word, but in reality, to serve others, and thought he
saw his chance of doing so in government service. Systematically
looking over the various activities to which
he might devote his energies, he decided that he could
be most useful in the legislative department, and entered
it. But notwithstanding his most accurate and conscientious
attention to his duties, he found nothing in them to
satisfy his desire to be useful. His discontent, due to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>the pettiness and vanity of his immediate superiors, grew
until an opportunity offered to enter the Senate. He
was better off in the Senate, but the same feeling of dissatisfaction
pursued him. He constantly felt that things
were not what he expected them to be, and what they
should be. During his service in the Senate, his relations
obtained for him the post of gentleman of the Emperor's
bed-chamber, and he was obliged to drive around in
gorgeous uniform to thank various people. In this post
he felt even more than before out of place. At the same
time, on the one hand, he could not refuse the appointment,
because he would not disappoint those who thought
they were pleasing him by it, and, on the other hand, the
appointment flattered his vanity. It pleased him to see
himself in a looking-glass in a gold embroidered uniform,
and to receive the tokens of respect shown him by some
people on his appointment.</p>

<p>The same thing happened with respect to his marriage.
A brilliant match was arranged for him, as it is regarded
from the world's standpoint. And he married principally
because to refuse would have been to offend and cause
pain to the bride and those who had arranged the match.
Hence the marriage to a young, pretty, distinguished girl
flattered his vanity and gave him pleasure. But the marriage
soon turned out to be "not the thing, you know,"
more so even than Court service. After her first child,
his wife did not wish to have any more, and plunged
into luxurious social life, in which he was obliged to
participate nolens volens. Although this poisoned the
life of her husband, and brought her only exertion and
fatigue, she nevertheless diligently pursued it. All his
efforts to change her mode of life could not alter her
confidence, supported by all her relatives and acquaintances,
that it was quite proper.</p>

<p>The child, a girl with long, golden curls, was an entire
stranger to her father, mainly because she was brought
up not in accord with his desires. The result was the
customary misunderstanding between the husband and
wife, and even in a want of desire to understand each
other, and a quiet, silent struggle, hidden from strangers
and tempered by propriety, which made Selenin's life at
home very burdensome. So that his family life turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>out to be "not the thing, you know," in still greater degree
than his service or the Court appointment.</p>

<p>These were the reasons why his eyes were always sad.
And this was why, seeing Nekhludoff, whom he had
known before all these lies had fastened themselves upon
him, he thought of himself as he had been then, and more
than ever felt the discord between his character and his
surroundings, and he became painfully sad. The same
feeling came over Nekhludoff, after the first impression
of joy at meeting an old friend.</p>

<p>That was why, having promised that they would meet
each other, neither sought that meeting, nor had they
seen each other on this visit of Nekhludoff to St. Petersburg.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XV" id="CHAPTER_2-XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>On leaving the Senate, Nekhludoff and his lawyer
walked along the sidewalk. Fanirin told his driver to
follow him, and he began to relate to Nekhludoff how the
mistress of so-and-so had made millions on 'Change,
how so-and-so had sold, and another had bought, his wife.
He also related some stories of swindling and all sorts
of crimes committed by well-known people who were not
occupying cells in prison, but presidents' chairs in various
institutions. These stories, of which he seemed to possess
an inexhaustible source, afforded the lawyer great
pleasure, as showing most conclusively that the means
employed by him as a lawyer to make money were perfectly
innocent in comparison with those used by the more
noted public men of St. Petersburg. And the lawyer was
greatly surprised when Nekhludoff, in the middle of one
of these stories, hailed a trap, took leave and drove
home. Nekhludoff was very sad. He was sad because
the Senate's judgment continued the unreasonable suffering
of the innocent Maslova, and also because it made
it more difficult for him to carry out his unalterable intention
of joining his fate to hers. His sadness increased
as the lawyer related with so much pleasure the frightful
stories of the prevailing wickedness. Besides, the unkind,
cold, repelling gaze of the once charming, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>open-hearted
and noble Selenin constantly recurred to his mind.
Nekhludoff, after the impressions of his stay in St. Petersburg,
was almost in despair of ever reaching any results.
All the plans he had laid out in Moskow seemed
to him like those youthful dreams which usually end in
disappointment. However, he considered it his duty,
while in St. Petersburg, to exhaust his resources in endeavoring
to fulfill his mission.</p>

<p>Soon after he reached his room, a servant called him
upstairs for tea. Mariette, in a multi-colored dress, was
sitting beside the Countess, sipping tea. On Nekhludoff's
entering the room, Mariette had just dropped some funny,
indecent joke. Nekhludoff noticed it by the character of
their laughter. The good-natured, mustached Countess
Catherine Ivanovna was shaking in all her stout body
with laughter, while Mariette, with a particularly mischievous
expression, and her energetic and cheerful face
somewhat bent to one side, was silently looking at her
companion.</p>

<p>"You will be the death of me," said the Countess, in a
fit of coughing.</p>

<p>No sooner had Nekhludoff seated himself than Mariette,
noticing the serious and slightly displeased expression on
his face, immediately changed not only her expression, but
her frame of mind. This was with the intention she had
in mind since she first saw him&mdash;to get him to like her.
She suddenly became grave, dissatisfied with her life,
seeking something, striving after something. She not
merely feigned, but actually induced in herself a state of
mind similar to that in which Nekhludoff was, although
she would not be able to say what it consisted of. In a
sympathetic conversation about the injustice of the strong,
the poverty of the people, the awful condition of the
prisoners, she succeeded in rousing in him the least expected
feeling of physical attraction, and under the din of
conversation their eyes plainly queried, "Can you love
me?" and they answered, "Yes, I can."</p>

<p>On leaving, she told him that she was always ready
to be of service to him, and asked him to visit her at the
theatre the next day, if only for a minute, saying that
she wished to have a talk with him on a matter of importance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>"When will I see you again?" she added, sighing, and
carefully putting the gloves on her ring-bedecked hand.
"Tell me that you will come."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff promised to come.</p>

<p>For a long time that night Nekhludoff could not fall
asleep. When he recalled Maslova, the decision of the
Senate, and his determination to follow her; when he recalled
his relinquishment of his right to the land, there
suddenly appeared before him, as if in answer to these
questions, the face of Mariette; her sigh and glance when
she said, "When will I see you again?" and her smile&mdash;all
so distinct that she seemed to stand before him, and he
smiled himself. "Would it be proper for me to follow her
to Siberia? And would it be proper to deprive myself of
my property?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>And the answers to these questions on that bright St.
Petersburg night were indefinite. His mind was all in
confusion. He called forth his former trend of thought,
but those thoughts had lost their former power of conviction.</p>

<p>"And what if all my ideas are due to an over-wrought
imagination, and I should be unable to live up to them?
If I should repent of what I have done?" he asked himself,
and, being unable to find answers to these questions,
he was stricken with such sadness and despair as he had
rarely experienced before, and he fell into that deep
slumber which had been habitual with him after heavy
losses at cards.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XVI" id="CHAPTER_2-XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff's first feeling on rising the following morning
was that he had committed something abominable the
preceding evening.</p>

<p>He began to recall what had happened. There was
nothing abominable; he had done nothing wrong. He
had only thought that all his present intentions&mdash;that of
marrying Katiousha, giving the land to the peasants&mdash;artificial,
unnatural, and that he must continued to live
as he had lived before.</p>

<p>He could recall no wrong act, but he remembered what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>was worse than a wrong act&mdash;there were the bad thoughts
in which all bad acts have their origin. Bad acts may
not be repeated; one may repent of them, while bad
thoughts give birth to bad acts.</p>

<p>A bad act only smooths the way to other bad acts, while
bad thoughts irresistibly lead toward them.</p>

<p>Recalling his thoughts of the day before, Nekhludoff
wondered how he could have believed them. How so
novel and difficult might be that which he intended to
do, he knew that it was the only life possible to him now,
and that, however easy it might be for him to return to
his old mode of life, he knew that that was death, not
life. This temptation of the day before was similar to
that of a man who, after a night's sound sleep, feels like
taking his ease on the soft mattress for a while, although
he knows that it is time to be up and away on an important
affair.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Nekhludoff would have left the same evening but for
his promise to Mariette to visit her at the theatre. Though
he knew that it was wrong to do it, he went there, contrary
to the dictates of his own conscience, considering
himself bound to keep his word. Besides his wish to
see Mariette again, he also wished, as he thought, to
measure himself against that world lately so near, but
now so strange to him.</p>

<p>"Could I withstand these temptations?" he thought,
but not with entire sincerity. "I will try it for the last
time."</p>

<p>Attired in a dress-coat, he arrived in the theatre where
the eternal "Dame aux Camelias" was being played. A
French actress was showing in a novel way how consumptive
women die.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff was shown to the box occupied by Mariette.
In the corridor a liveried servant bowed and opened the
door for him.</p>

<p>All the spectators in the circle of boxes&mdash;sitting and
standing, gray-haired, bald and pomaded heads&mdash;were
intently following the movements of a slim actress making
wry faces and in an unnatural voice reading a monologue.
Some one hissed when the door was opened, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>two streams of cold and warm air were wafted on Nekhludoff's
face.</p>

<p>In the box he found Mariette and a strange lady with
a red mantle over her <a name="shoulders" id="shoulders"></a>shoulders and high head-dress, and
two men&mdash;a general, Mariette's husband, a handsome,
tall man with a high, artificial, military breast, and a
flaxen haired, bald-headed man with shaved chin and
solemn side-whiskers. Mariette, graceful, slim, elegant,
decolette, with her strong, muscular shoulders sloping
down from the neck, at the jointure of which was a darkening
little mole, immediately turned around, and, pointing
with her fan to a chair behind her, greeted him with
a welcome, grateful, and, as it seemed to Nekhludoff,
significant smile. Her husband calmly, as was his wont,
looked at Nekhludoff and bowed his head. In the glance
which he exchanged with his wife, as in everything else,
he looked the master, the owner, of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>There was a thunder of applause when the monologue
ended. Mariette rose, and, holding in one hand her
rustling silk skirt, walked to the rear of the box and introduced
Nekhludoff to her husband. The general incessantly
smiled with his eyes, said he was glad, and remained
calm and mute.</p>

<p>"I had to leave to-day, but I promised you," said Nekhludoff,
turning to Mariette.</p>

<p>"If you don't wish to see me, you will see a remarkable
actress," Mariette said, answering the meaning of his
words. "Wasn't she great in the last scene?" she turned
to her husband.</p>

<p>The general bowed his head.</p>

<p>"That does not affect me," said Nekhludoff. "I have
seen so much real misfortune to-day that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down and tell us what you have seen."</p>

<p>The husband listened, and ironically smiled with his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I went to see that woman who has been released. She
is entirely broken down."</p>

<p>"That is the woman of whom I have spoken to you,"
Mariette said to her husband.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was very glad that she could be released," he
calmly said, nodding his head and smiling ironically, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>it seemed to Nekhludoff, under his mustache. "I will go
to the smoking-room."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff waited, expecting that Mariette would tell
him that something which she said she had to tell him,
but instead she only jested and talked of the performance,
which, she thought, ought to affect him particularly.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff understood that the only purpose for which
she had brought him to the theatre was to display her
evening toilet with her shoulders and mole, and he was
both pleased and disgusted. Now he saw what was under
the veil of the charm that at first attracted him. Looking
on Mariette, he admired her, but he knew that she was
a prevaricator who was living with her career-making
husband; that what she had said the other day was untrue,
and that she only wished&mdash;and neither knew why&mdash;to
make him love her. And, as has been said, he was
both pleased and disgusted. Several times he attempted
to leave, took his hat but still remained. But finally,
when the general, his thick mustache reeking with tobacco,
returned to the box and glanced at Nekhludoff
patronizingly disdainful, as if he did not recognize him,
Nekhludoff walked out before the door closed behind the
general, and, finding his overcoat, left the theatre.</p>

<p>On his way home he suddenly noticed before him a
tall, well-built, loudly-dressed woman. Every passer-by
turned to look at her. Nekhludoff walked quicker than
the woman, and also involuntarily looked her in the face.
Her face, probably rouged, was pretty; her eyes flashed
at him, and she smiled. Nekhludoff involuntarily thought
of Mariette, for he experienced the same feeling of attraction
and disgust which took hold of him in the
theatre. Passing her hastily, Nekhludoff turned the corner
of the street, and, to the surprise of the policeman,
began to walk up and down the water-front.</p>

<p>"That one in the theatre also smiled that way when I
entered," he thought, "and the smile of the former conveyed
the same meaning as that of the latter. The only
difference between them is that this one speaks openly
and plainly, while the other pretends to be exercising
higher and refined feelings. But in reality they are alike.
This one is at least truthful, while the other is lying."
Nekhludoff recalled his relations with the wife of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>district commander, and a flood of shameful recollections
came upon him. "There is a disgusting bestiality in
man," he thought; "but when it is in a primitive state,
one looks down upon and despises it, whether he is
carried away with or withstands it. But when this same
bestiality hides itself under a so-called aesthetic, poetic
cover, and demands to be worshiped, then, deifying the
beast, one gives himself up to it, without distinguishing
between the good and the bad. Then it is horrible."</p>

<p>As there was no soothing, rest-giving darkness that
night, but instead there was a hazy, cheerless, unnatural
light, so even was there no rest-giving darkness&mdash;ignorance&mdash;for
Nekhludoff's soul. Everything was clear.
It was plain that all that is considered important and
useful is really insignificant and wicked, and that all that
splendor and luxury were hiding old crimes, familiar to
every one, and not only stalking unpunished, but triumphing
and adorned with all the allurements man is capable
of conceiving.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff wished to forget it, not to see it, but he
could no longer help seeing it. Although he did not see
the source of the light which revealed these things to him,
as he did not see the source of the light which spread
over St. Petersburg, and though this light seemed to him
hazy, cheerless and unnatural, he could not help seeing
that which the light revealed to him, and he felt at the
same time both joy and alarm.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XVII" id="CHAPTER_2-XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>Immediately upon his arrival in Moskow, Nekhludoff
made his way to the prison hospital, intending to make
known to Maslova the Senate's decision and to tell her
to prepare for the journey to Siberia.</p>

<p>Of the petition which he brought for Maslova's signature,
he had little hope. And, strange to say, he no longer
wished to succeed. He had accustomed himself to the
thought of going to Siberia, and living among the exiles
and convicts, and it was difficult for him to imagine how
he should order his life and that of Maslova if she were
freed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>The door-keeper at the hospital, recognizing Nekhludoff,
immediately informed him that Maslova was no
longer there.</p>

<p>"Where is she, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, again in the prison."</p>

<p>"Why was she transferred?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency knows their kind," said the door-keeper,
with a contemptuous smile. "She was making
love to the assistant, so the chief physician sent her back."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff did not suspect that Maslova and her spiritual
condition were so close to him. This news stunned
him. The feeling he experienced was akin to that which
people experience when hearing suddenly of some great
misfortune. He was deeply grieved. The first feeling
he experienced was that of shame. His joyful portraying
of her spiritual awakening now seemed to him ridiculous.
Her reluctance to accept his sacrifice, the reproaches
and the tears, were the mere cunning, he thought,
of a dissolute woman who wished to make the most use of
him. It seemed to him now that at his last visit he had
seen in her the symptoms of incorrigibility which were
now evident. All this flashed through his mind at the
time he instinctively donned his hat and left the hospital.</p>

<p>"But what's to be done now?" he asked himself. "Am
I bound to her? Am I not released now by this, her
act?"</p>

<p>But no sooner did he form the question than he understood
that in considering himself released and leaving her
to her fate he would be punishing not her, which he desired,
but himself, and he was terrified.</p>

<p>"No! That will not alter my decision&mdash;it will only
strengthen it. Let her do whatever her soul prompts her
to do; if she would make love to the assistant, let her
do so. It is her business. It is my business to do what
my conscience demands," he said to himself. "And my
conscience demands that I sacrifice my liberty in expiation
of my sin, and my decision to marry her, although
but fictitiously, and follow her wherever she may be sent,
remains unaltered," he said to himself, with spiteful obstinacy,
and, leaving the hospital, he made his way with
resolute step to the prison gate.</p>

<p>Coming to the gate, he asked the officer on duty to tell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>the inspector that he wished to see Maslova. The officer
knew Nekhludoff, and told him an important piece of
prison news. The captain had resigned, and another
man, who was very strict, had taken his place.</p>

<p>The inspector, who was in the prison at the time, soon
made his appearance. He was tall, bony, very slow in
his movements, and gloomy.</p>

<p>"Visitors are allowed only on certain days," he said,
without looking at Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"But I have a petition here which she must sign."</p>

<p>"You may give it to me."</p>

<p>"I must see the prisoner myself. I was always permitted
to see her before."</p>

<p>"That was before," said the inspector, glancing at
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I have a pass from the Governor," Nekhludoff insisted,
producing his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said the inspector, without looking in
Nekhludoff's eyes, and taking the document with his
skinny, long, white hand, on the index finger of which
there was a gold ring, he slowly read it. "Walk into the
office, please," he said.</p>

<p>On this occasion there was no one in the office. The
inspector seated himself at the table, looking through the
papers that lay on it, evidently intending to stay through
the meeting. When Nekhludoff asked him if Bogodukhovskaia
could be seen, he answered: "Visiting the politicals
is not allowed," and again buried his head in the
papers.</p>

<p>When Maslova entered the room, the inspector raised
his eyes, and, without looking either at Maslova or Nekhludoff,
said: "You may go ahead," and continued to busy
himself with his papers.</p>

<p>Maslova was again dressed in a white skirt, waist and
'kerchief. Coming near Nekhludoff and seeing his cold,
angry face, her own turned a purple color, and, with
downcast eyes, she began to pick a corner of her waist.
Her confusion Nekhludoff considered as confirmation of
the hospital porter's words.</p>

<p>So abhorent was she to him now that he <i>could not</i>
extend his hand to her, as he desired.</p>

<span class="caption">WARDEN AND MATRON.</span>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>"I bring you bad news," he said in an even voice, without
looking at her. "The Senate affirmed the verdict."</p>

<p>"I knew it would be so," she said in a strange voice, as
if choking.</p>

<p>If it had happened before, Nekhludoff would have
asked her why she knew it; now he only looked at her.
Her eyes were filled with tears, but this not only did
not soften him, but made him even more inflamed against
her.</p>

<p>The inspector rose and began to walk up and down
the room.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the abhorence Nekhludoff felt for
Maslova, he thought it proper to express his regret at
the Senate's action.</p>

<p>"Do not despair," he said. "This petition may be more
successful, and I hope that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not that," she said, looking at him with the
tearful and squinting eyes.</p>

<p>"What, then?"</p>

<p>"You have been in the hospital, and they must have
told you there about me."</p>

<p>"What of it? That is your business," frowning, Nekhludoff
said with indifference. The cruel feeling of offended
pride rose in him with greater force at her mention
of the hospital. "I, a man of the world, whom any
girl of the upper class would be only too happy to marry,
offered to become the husband of that woman, and she
could not wait, but made love to the assistant surgeon,"
he thought, looking at her with hatred.</p>

<p>"Sign this petition," he said, and, taking from his
pocket a large envelope, placed it on the table. She wiped
her tears with a corner of her 'kerchief, seated herself at
the table, and asked him where to sign.</p>

<p>He showed her where, and she, seating herself,
smoothed with her left hand the sleeve of the right. He
stood over her, silently looking at her back bent over
the table, and now and then shaking from the sobs she
tried to suppress, and his soul was convulsed by a struggle
between good and evil, between offended pride and
pity for her sufferings. The feeling of pity conquered.</p>

<p>Whether it was the feeling of pity that first asserted
itself, or the recollection of his own deeds of the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>character for which he reproached her, he scarcely knew,
but suddenly he felt himself guilty and pitied her.</p>

<p>Having signed the petition and wiped her soiled fingers
on her skirt, she rose and glanced at him.</p>

<p>"Whatever the result, and no matter what happens, I
shall keep my word," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>The thought that he was forgiving her strengthened
in him the feeling of pity and tenderness for her, and
he wished to console her.</p>

<p>"I will do what I said. I will be with you wherever
you may be."</p>

<p>"That's no use," she hastened to say, and her face became
radiant.</p>

<p>"Make note of what you need for the road."</p>

<p>"Nothing particular, I think. Thank you."</p>

<p>The inspector approached them, and Nekhludoff, without
waiting to be told that the time was up, took leave
of her, experiencing a new feeling of quiet happiness,
calmness and love for all mankind. It was the consciousness
that no act of Maslova could alter his love for her
that raised his spirit and made him feel happy. Let her
make love to the assistant&mdash;that was her business. He
loved her not for himself, but for her and for God.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The love-making for which Maslova was expelled from
the hospital, and to which Nekhludoff gave credence, consisted
only in that, when Maslova, coming to the drug
department for some pectoral herbs, prescribed by her
superior, she found there an assistant, named Ustinoff.
This Ustinoff had been pursuing her with his attentions
for a long time, and as he tried to embrace her she pushed
him away with such force that he struck the shelving,
and two bottles came crashing to the floor.</p>

<p>The chief physician was passing at the time, and, hearing
the sound of the breaking glass, and seeing Maslova
running out, all flushed, he angrily shouted to her:</p>

<p>"Well, girl, if you begin to flirt here, I will send you
back. What is the matter?" he turned to the assistant,
sternly looking over his spectacles.</p>

<p>The assistant, smiling, began to apologize. The doctor,
without hearing him to the last, raised his head so that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>he began to look through the glasses, and walked into
the ward. On the same day he asked the inspector to
send a more sedate nurse in place of Maslova. Maslova's
expulsion from the hospital on the ground of flirting was
particularly painful to her by reason of the fact that,
after her meeting with Nekhludoff, all association with
men, which had <i>been</i> so repugnant to her, became even
more disgusting.</p>

<p>The fact that, judging her by her past and present condition,
everybody, including the pimpled assistant, thought
that they had the right to insult her, and were surprised
when she refused their attentions, was very painful to
her and called forth her tears and pity for herself. Now,
coming out to see Nekhludoff, she wished to explain the
injustice of the charge which he had probably heard.
But as she attempted to do so, she felt that he would not
believe her; that her explanation would only tend to corroborate
the suspicion, and her tears welled up in her
throat, and she became silent.</p>

<p>Maslova was still thinking, and continued to assure herself
that, as she had told him on his second visit, she had
not forgiven him; that she hated him, but, in reality, she
had long since begun to love him again, and loved him
so that she involuntarily carried out his wishes. She
ceased to drink and smoke, she gave up flirting, and
willingly went as servant to the hospital. All this she
did because she knew he wished it. Her repeated refusal
to accept his sacrifice was partly due to the fact that she
wished to repeat those proud words which she had once
told him, and mainly because she knew that their marriage
would make him unhappy. She was firmly resolved
not to accept his sacrifice, and yet it was painful
for her to think that he despised her; that he thought
her to be the same as she had been, and did not see the
change she was undergoing. The fact that he was at that
moment thinking that she did something wrong in the
hospital pained her more than the news that she was
finally sentenced to hard labor.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XVIII" id="CHAPTER_2-XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>Maslova might be sent away with the first party of
exiles; hence Nekhludoff was preparing for departure.
But he had so many things to attend to that he felt
that he could never get through with them, no matter
how much time there might be left for preparations. It
was different in former times. Then it was necessary to
devise something to do, and the interest in all his affairs
centered in Dmitri Ivanovich Nekhludoff. But though
all interest in life centered in Dmitri Ivanovich, he always
suffered from ennui. Now, however, all his affairs
related to people other than Dmitri Ivanovich, and were
all interesting and attractive, as well as inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Besides, formerly the occupation with the affairs of
Dmitri Ivanovich always caused vexation and irritation;
while these affairs of others for the most part put him
in a happy mood.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff's affairs were now divided into three parts.
He himself, in his habitual pedantism, thus divided them,
and according placed them in three different portfolios.</p>

<p>The first was that of Maslova. This consisted in efforts
to obtain a successful result in the pending petition, and
preparations for departure to Siberia.</p>

<p>The second part related to the settlement of his estates.
The Panov land was granted to the peasants on condition
of their paying a rent to be used for common necessities.
But, in order to complete that arrangement, it was necessary
to sign an agreement and also make his will. The
arrangement made for the Kusminskoie estate was to
remain in force, only there remained to be determined
what part of the rent he was to appropriate to himself,
and what was to be left for the benefit of the peasants.
Without knowing what his necessary disbursements
would be on his trip to Siberia, he could not make up
his mind to deprive himself of his income, although
he reduced it by one-half.</p>

<p>The third part related to aid to prisoners, who were
now applying to him more and more frequently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>At first, when written to for aid, he proceeded immediately
to intercede for the applicants, endeavoring to
relieve their condition, but in the end their number became
so great that he found it impossible to help every
one, and was involuntarily brought to a fourth matter,
which had of late occupied him more than either of the
others.</p>

<p>His fourth concern consisted in solving the question,
Why, how and whence came that remarkable institution
called the Criminal Court, to which was due the existence
of that prison, with the inmates of which he had become
somewhat familiar, and all those places of confinement,
beginning with the fortress dedicated to two saints, Peter
and Paul, and ending with the island of Saghalin, where
hundreds and thousands of victims of that wonderful
criminal law were languishing?</p>

<p>From personal contact with prisoners, and from information
received from the lawyer, the prison chaplain,
the inspector, and from the prison register, Nekhludoff
came to the conclusion that the prisoners, so-called criminals,
could be divided into five classes. The first class
consisted of people entirely innocent, victims of judicial
mistakes, such as that would-be incendiary, Menshov, or
Maslova, and others. There were comparatively few
people of this class, according to the observations of the
chaplain&mdash;about seven per cent.&mdash;but their condition attracted
particular attention. The second class consisted
of people convicted for offenses committed under exceptional
circumstances, such as anger, jealousy, drunkenness,
etc.&mdash;offenses which, under similar circumstances,
would almost invariably have been committed by all those
who judged and punished them. This class made up,
according to Nekhludoff's observations, more than one-half
of all the prisoners. To the third class belonged
those who committed, according to their own ideas, the
most indifferent or even good acts, but which were considered
criminal by people&mdash;entire strangers to them&mdash;who
were making the laws. To this class belonged all
those who carried on a secret trade in wine, or were bringing
in contraband goods, or were picking herbs, or gathering
wood, in private or government forests. To this
class also belonged the predatory mountaineers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>The fourth class consisted of people who, according to
Nekhludoff, were reckoned among the criminals only because
they were morally above the average level of society.
Among these the percentage of those who resisted
interference with their affairs, or were sentenced for resisting
the authorities, was very large.</p>

<p>The fifth class, finally, was composed of people who
were more sinned against by society than they sinned
themselves. These were the helpless people, blunted by
constant oppression and temptation, like that boy with the
mats, and hundreds of others whom Nekhludoff saw both
in and out of prison, and the conditions of those
whose lives systematically drove them to the necessity of
committing those acts which are called crimes. To these
people belonged, according to Nekhludoff's observations,
many thieves and murderers, with some of whom Nekhludoff
had come in contact. Among these Nekhludoff
found, on close acquaintance, those spoiled and depraved
people whom the new school calls the criminal type, and
the existence of which in society is given as the reason for
the necessity of criminal law and punishment. These so-called
depraved types, deviating from the normal, were,
according to Nekhludoff, none other than those very
people who have sinned less against society than society
has sinned against them, and against whom society has
sinned, not directly, but through their ancestors.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff's attention was attracted by a habitual thief,
Okhotin, who came under this head. He was the son of a
fallen woman; had grown up in lodging-houses, and till the
age of thirty had never met a moral man. In childhood he
had fallen in with a gang of thieves, but he possessed a
humorous vein which attracted people to him. While asking
Nekhludoff for aid he jested at himself, the judges,
the prison and all the laws, not only criminal, but even
divine. There was also a fine-looking man, Fedorff, who,
in company with a gang of which he was the leader, had
killed and robbed an old official. This one was a peasant
whose father's house had been illegally taken from him,
and who, while in the army, suffered for falling in love
with an officer's mistress. He was attractive and passionate.
His sole desire in life was to enjoy himself, and he
had never met any people who, out of any consideration,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>tempered their passions, nor had he ever heard that there
was any other aim in life than personal enjoyment. It was
plain to Nekhludoff that these two were richly endowed
by nature, and were only neglected and mutilated as plants
are sometimes neglected and mutilated. He also came
across a vagabond, and a woman, whose stupidity and apparent
cruelty were repulsive, but he failed to find in them
that criminal type spoken of by the Italian school. He
only saw in them people who were disagreeable to him personally,
like some he had met in dress-coats, uniforms, and
laces.</p>

<p>Thus the investigation of the question: Why are people
of such great variety of character confined in prisons,
while others, no different than those, enjoy freedom and
even judge those people? was the fourth concern of Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>At first he hoped to find an answer to this question in
books, and bought every book bearing on the subject. He
bought the works of Lombroso, Garofalo, Ferri, Mandsley
and Tard, and read them carefully. But the more he read
them, the greater was his disappointment. The same
thing happened with him that happens with people who
appeal to science with direct, simple, vital questions, and
not with a view of playing the part of an expounder,
writer or teacher in it. Science solved a thousand and one
various abstruse, complicated questions bearing on criminal
law, but failed to give an answer to the question he
had formed. His question was very simple: Why and by
what right do some people confine, torture, exile, flog and
kill other people no different than they are themselves?
And in answer they argued the questions: Whether or
not man is a free agent? Can a criminal be distinguished
by the measurements of his cranium? To what
extent is crime due to heredity? What is morality? What
is insanity? What is degeneracy? What is temperament?
How does climate, food, ignorance, emulation, hypnotism,
passion affect crime? What is society? What are its
duties? etc., etc.</p>

<p>These arguments reminded Nekhludoff of an answer he
had once received from a schoolboy. He asked the boy
whether he had learned the declension of nouns. "Yes,"
answered the boy. "Well, then decline 'Paw.'" "What
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>paw? A dog's paw?" the boy answered, with a sly expression
on his face. Similar answers in the form of questions
Nekhludoff found in scientific books to his one basic
question.</p>

<p>He found there many wise, learned and interesting
things, but there was no answer to his principal question:
By what right do some people punish others? Not only
was there no answer, but all reasoning tended to explain
and justify punishment, the necessity of which was considered
an axiom. Nekhludoff read much, but only by
fits and starts, and the want of an answer he ascribed to
such superficial reading. He, therefore, refused to believe
in the justice of the answer which constantly occurred to
him.</p>

<p>The deportation of the party of convicts to which Maslova
belonged was set for the fifth of July, and Nekhludoff
was prepared to follow her on that day. The day before
his departure his sister, with her husband, arrived in town
to see him.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff's sister, Natalie Ivanovna Ragojhinsky,
was ten years his senior. He had grown up partly under
her influence. She loved him when he was a boy, and before
her marriage they treated each other as equals; she
was twenty-five and he was fifteen. She had been in love
then with his deceased friend, Nikolenka Irtenieff. They
both loved Nikolenka, and loved in him and in themselves
the good that was in them, and which unifies all people.</p>

<p>Since that time they had both became corrupted&mdash;he
by the bad life he was leading; she by her marriage to a
man whom she loved sensually, but who not only did not
love all that which she and Dimitri at one time considered
most holy and precious, but did not even understand it,
and all those aspirations to moral perfection and to serving
others, to which she had once devoted herself, he ascribed
to selfishness and a desire to show off before people.</p>

<p>Ragojhinsky was a man without reputation or fortune,
but a clever fortune hunter, who, by skillful man&#339;uvering
between liberalism and conservatism, availing himself of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>that dominating tendency which promised bitter results in
life, but principally by something peculiar which attracted
women to him, he succeeded in making a relatively brilliant
judicial career. He was already past his youth when
he met Nekhludoff abroad, made Natalie, who was also
not very young, to fall in love with him, and married her
almost against the wish of her mother, who said that it
would be a m&eacute;salliance. Nekhludoff, although he concealed
it from himself and struggled against the feeling,
hated his brother-in-law. He disliked his vulgar feelings,
his self-confident narrowness of mind, but, principally, because
of his sister, who should so passionately, egotistically
and sensually love such a poor nature, and to please
whom she should stifle all her noble sentiments. It was
always painful to Nekhludoff to think of Natalie as the
wife of that hairy, self-confident man, with shining bald
head. He could not even suppress his aversion to his children.
And whenever he heard that she was about to become
a mother, he experienced a feeling of compassion
for her being again infected with something bad by the
man who was so unlike all of them.</p>

<p>The Ragojhinskys arrived without their children, and
engaged the best suite in the best hotel. Natalie Ivanovna
immediately went to the old home of her mother, and
learning there that her brother had moved to furnished
rooms, she went to his new home. The dirty servant,
meeting her in the dark, ill-smelling corridor, which was
lit up by a lamp during the day, announced that the Prince
was away.</p>

<p>Desiring to leave a note, Natalie Ivanovna was shown
into his apartments. She closely examined the two small
rooms. She noticed in every corner the familiar cleanliness
and order, and she was struck by the modesty of the
appointments. On the writing table she saw a familiar
paper-press, with the bronze figure of a dog, neatly arranged
portfolios, papers, volumes of the Criminal Code
and an English book of Henry George, and a French one
by Tard, between the leaves of which was an ivory paper
knife.</p>

<p>She left a note asking him to call on her the same evening,
and, shaking her head in wonder at what she had
seen, returned to her hotel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>There were two questions relating to her brother that
interested Natalie Ivanovna&mdash;his marriage to Katiousha,
of which she had heard in her city, where it was a matter
of common gossip, and the distribution by him of his land
to the peasants, upon which some people looked as something
political and dangerous. From one point of view,
she rather liked the idea of his marrying Katiousha. She
admired his resolution, seeing in it herself and him as they
had been before her marriage. At the same time, she was
horror-stricken at the thought that her brother was to
marry such an awful woman. The latter feeling was the
stronger, and she decided to dissuade him from marrying
her, although she knew how hard that would be.</p>

<p>The other affair, that of his parting with his land, she
did not take so close to heart, but her husband was indignant
at such folly, and demanded that she influence her
brother to abandon the attempt. Ignatius Nikiforovitch
said that it was the height of inconsistency, foolhardiness
and pride; that such an act could only be explained, if at
all, by a desire to be odd, to have something to brag about,
and to make people talk about one's self.</p>

<p>"What sense is there in giving the land to the peasants
and making them pay rent to themselves?" he said. "If
his mind was set on doing it, he could sell them the land
through the bank. There would be some sense in that.
Taking all in all, his act is very eccentric," said Ignatius
Nikiforovitch, already considering the necessity of a
guardianship, and he demanded that his wife should seriously
speak to her brother of this, his strange intention.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XX" id="CHAPTER_2-XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>In the evening Nekhludoff went to his sister. Ignatius
Nikiforovitch was resting in another room, and Natalie
Ivanovna alone met him. She wore a tight-fitting black
silk dress, with a knot of red ribbon, and her hair was
done up according to the latest fashion. She was evidently
making herself look young for her husband. Seeing
her brother, she quickly rose from the divan, and, rustling
with her silk skirt, she went out to meet him. They kissed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>and, smiling, looked at each other. There was an exchange
of those mysterious, significant glances in which
everything was truth; then followed an exchange of words
in which that truth was lacking. They had not met since
the death of their mother.</p>

<p>"You have grown stout and young," he said.</p>

<p>Her lips contracted with pleasure.</p>

<p>"And you have grown thin."</p>

<p>"Well, how is Ignatius Nikiforovitch?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"He is resting. He has not slept all night."</p>

<p>A great deal should have been said here, but their words
said nothing, and their glances said that that which interested
them most was left unsaid.</p>

<p>"I have been at your lodging."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it. I have moved from the house. I am
so lonely and weary. I do not need any of those things,
so you take them&mdash;the furniture&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"Yes, Agrippina Petrovna told me. I have been there.
I thank you very much. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment the servant brought in a silver tea service.
Natalie Ivanovna busied herself with making the tea.
Nekhludoff was silent.</p>

<p>"Well, Dimitri, I know everything," Natalie said, resolutely,
glancing at him.</p>

<p>"I am very glad that you know."</p>

<p>"Do you think it possible to reform her after such a
life?"</p>

<p>He was sitting erect on a small chair, attentively listening
to her, prepared to answer satisfactorily her every
question. He was still in that frame of mind which, after
his last meeting with Maslova, filled his soul with tranquil
happiness and love for all mankind.</p>

<p>"It is not her that I intend to reform, but myself," he
answered.</p>

<p>Natalie Ivanovna sighed.</p>

<p>"There are other means besides marriage."</p>

<p>"And I think that that is the best. Besides, that will
bring me into that world in which I can be useful."</p>

<p>"I do not think," said Natalie Ivanovna, "that you could
be happy."</p>

<p>"It is not a question of my happiness."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>"Of course; but if she possesses a heart, she cannot be
happy&mdash;she cannot even desire it."</p>

<p>"She does not."</p>

<p>"I understand, but life&mdash;demands something different."</p>

<p>"Life only demands that we do what is right," said
Nekhludoff, looking at her face, still beautiful, although
covered with fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>"Poor dear! How she has changed!" thought Nekhludoff,
recalling Natalie as she had been before her marriage,
and a tender feeling, woven of countless recollections
of their childhood, rose in his breast toward her.</p>

<p>At that moment Ignatius Nikiforovitch, as usual holding
his head high and projecting his broad chest, entered
the room, with shining eye-glasses, bald head and black
beard.</p>

<p>"How do you do? How do you do?" he greeted Nekhludoff,
unnaturally accentuating his words.</p>

<p>They pressed each other's hand, and Ignatius Nikiforovitch
lowered himself into an arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Am I disturbing you?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not conceal anything I say or do from anybody."</p>

<p>As soon as Nekhludoff saw that face, those hairy hands
and heard that patronizing tone, his gentle disposition immediately
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have been speaking about his intention," said
Natalie Ivanovna. "Shall I pour out some tea for you?"
she added, taking the tea-pot.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you please. What intention do you refer to?"</p>

<p>"My intention of going to Siberia with that party of
convicts, among whom there is a woman I have wronged,"
said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I heard that you intended more than that."</p>

<p>"Yes, and marry her, if she only desires it."</p>

<p>"I see! And may I ask you to explain your motives, if
it is not unpleasant to you? I do not understand them."</p>

<p>"My motives are that that woman&mdash;that the first step
on her downward career&mdash;&mdash;" Nekhludoff became angry
because he could not find the proper expression. "My
motives are that I am guilty, while she is punished."</p>

<p>"If she is punished, then she is also, probably, guilty."</p>

<p>"She is perfectly innocent."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>And, with unnecessary agitation, Nekhludoff related the
whole case.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was an omission by the presiding justice.
But in such cases there is the Senate."</p>

<p>"The Senate sustained the verdict."</p>

<p>"Ah, then there were no grounds of appeal," said Ignatius
Nikiforovitch, evidently sharing the well-known opinion
that truth is the product of court proceedings. "The
Senate cannot go into the merits of a case. But if there
is really a judicial error, a petition should be made to the
Emperor."</p>

<p>"That was done, but there is no chance of success. Inquiries
will be made at the Ministry, which will refer them
to the Senate, and the Senate will repeat its decision, and,
as usual, the innocent will be punished."</p>

<p>"In the first place, the Ministry will not refer to the
Senate," and Ignatius <a name="Nikiforovitch" id="Nikiforovitch"></a>Nikiforovitch smiled condescendingly,
"but will call for all the documents in the case, and, if
it finds an error, will so decide. In the second place, an
innocent person is never, or, at least, very seldom punished.
Only the guilty is punished."</p>

<p>"And I am convinced that the contrary is true," said
Nekhludoff, with an unkind feeling toward his brother-in-law.
"I am convinced that the majority of the people convicted
by courts are innocent."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"They are innocent in the ordinary sense of the word,
as that woman was innocent of poisoning; as that peasant
is innocent of the murder which he has not committed; as
that mother and son are innocent of the arson which was
committed by the owner himself, and for which they came
near being convicted."</p>

<p>"Of course, there always have been and always will be
judicial errors. Human institutions cannot be perfect."</p>

<p>"And, then, a large part of the innocent, because they
have been brought up amid certain conditions, do not consider
the acts committed by them criminal."</p>

<p>"Pardon me; that is unfair. Every thief knows that
stealing is wrong; that theft is immoral," Ignatius Nikiforovitch
said, with the calm, self-confident, and, at the
same time, somewhat contemptuous, smile which particularly
provoked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>"No, he does not know. He is told not to steal, but he
sees and knows that the employers steal his labor, keep
back his pay, and that the officials are constantly robbing
him."</p>

<p>"That is anarchism," Ignatius calmly defined the meaning
of his brother-in-law's words.</p>

<p>"I do not know what it is, but I am speaking of facts,"
Nekhludoff continued. "He knows that the officials are
robbing him. He knows that we, the landlords, own the
land which ought to be common property, and when he
gathers some twigs for his oven we send him to jail and
try to convince him that he is a thief."</p>

<p>"I do not understand, and if I do, I cannot agree with
you. The land cannot be nobody's property. If you divide
it," Ignatius Nikiforovitch began, being fully convinced
that Nekhludoff was a socialist, and that the theory
of socialism demands that all the land should be divided
equally; that such division is foolish, and that he can
easily refute it. "If you should divide the land to-day,
giving each inhabitant an equal share, to-morrow it will
again find its way into the hands of the more industrious
and able among them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nobody even thinks of dividing the land into equal
shares. There ought to be no property in land, and it
ought not to be the subject of purchase and sale or renting."</p>

<p>"The right of property is a natural right. Without
property right there would be no interest in cultivating
the land. Destroy property right and we will return to
the condition of the savage," authoritatively said Ignatius
Nikiforovitch.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, only then will land not lie idle, as it
is now."</p>

<p>"But, Dimitri Ivanovich, it is perfect madness! Is it
possible in our time to destroy property in land? I know
it is your old hobby. But permit me to tell you plainly&mdash;&mdash;"
Ignatius Nikiforovitch turned pale and his voice
trembled. The question was evidently of particular concern
to him. "I would advise you to consider that question
well before attempting its practical solution."</p>

<p>"You are speaking of my personal affairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I assume that we are all placed in a certain position,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>and must assume the duties that result from that position,
must support those conditions of existence into
which we were born, which we have inherited from our
forefathers, and which we must hand over to our posterity."</p>

<p>"I consider it my duty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," continued Ignatius Nikiforovitch, who
would not be interrupted. "I am not speaking of myself
and my children. The fortune of my children is secure,
and I earn enough to live in easy circumstances, and,
therefore, my protest against your, permit me to say, ill-considered
actions is not based on personal interest, but
on principle. And I would advise you to give it a little
more thought, to read&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You had better let me decide my own affairs. I think
I know what to read and what not to read," said Nekhludoff,
turning pale, and, feeling that he could not control
himself, became silent and began to drink his tea.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XXI" id="CHAPTER_2-XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>"Well, how are the children?" Nekhludoff asked his sister,
having calmed down.</p>

<p>Thus the unpleasant conversation was changed. Natalie
became calm and talked about her children. She
would not speak, however, about those things which only
her brother understood in the presence of her husband,
and in order to continue the conversation she began to talk
of the latest news, the killing of Kanesky in the duel.</p>

<p>Ignatius Nikiforovitch expressed his disapproval of the
condition of things which excluded the killing in a duel
from the category of crimes.</p>

<p>His remark called forth Nekhludoff's reply, and a hot
discussion followed on the same subject, neither expressing
fully his opinion, and in the end they were again at
loggerheads.</p>

<p>Ignatius Nikiforovitch felt that Nekhludoff condemned
him, hating all his activity, and he wished to prove the injustice
of his reasoning. Nekhludoff, on the other hand,
to say nothing of the vexation caused him by his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>brother-in-law's
interference in his affairs (in the depth of his soul
he felt that his brother-in-law, his sister and their children,
as heirs, had the right to do so), was indignant at the calm
and confident manner of that narrow-minded man who
continued to consider legal and just that which to Nekhludoff
was undoubtedly foolish. This self-confidence irritated
him.</p>

<p>"What should the court do?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Sentence one of the duelists, as it would a common
murderer, to hard labor."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff's hands again turned cold, and he continued
with warmth:</p>

<p>"Well, what would be then?"</p>

<p>"Justice would be done."</p>

<p>"As if the aim of courts was to do justice!" said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Their aim is to support class interests. Courts, according
to my idea, are only instruments for the perpetuation
of conditions profitable to our class."</p>

<p>"That is an entirely new view," said Ignatius Nikiforovitch,
smiling calmly. "Usually somewhat different aims
are ascribed to courts."</p>

<p>"In theory, but not in practice, as I have learned. The
only aim of the courts is to preserve the existing state of
things, and for this reason they persecute and kill all those
who are above the common level and who wish to raise it
as well as those who are below it."</p>

<p>"I cannot agree with the view that criminals are executed
because they are above the level of the average. For
the most part they are the excrescence of society, just as
perverted, though in a different manner, as are those
criminal types whom you consider below the level of the
average."</p>

<p>"And I know people who are far above their judges."</p>

<p>But Ignatius Nikiforovitch, not accustomed to being interrupted
when speaking, did not listen to Nekhludoff,
which was particularly irritating to the latter, and continued
to talk while Nekhludoff was talking.</p>

<p>"I cannot agree with you that the aim of courts is to
support the existing order of things. The courts have
their aims: either the correction&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>"Prisons are great places for correction," Nekhludoff
put in.</p>

<p>"Or the removal," persistently continued Ignatius Nikiforovitch,
"of those depraved and savage people who
threaten the existence of society."</p>

<p>"That is just where the trouble is. Courts can do
neither the one nor the other. Society has no means of
doing it."</p>

<p>"How is that? I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;" asked Ignatius
Nikiforovitch, with a forced smile.</p>

<p>"I mean to say that there are only two sensible modes of
punishment&mdash;those that have been used in olden times:
corporal punishment and capital punishment. But with
the advance of civilization they have gone out of existence."</p>

<p>"That is both new and surprising to hear from you."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is sense in inflicting pain on a man that he
might not repeat that for which the pain was inflicted; and
it is perfectly sensible to cut the head off a harmful and
dangerous member of society. But what sense is there in
imprisoning a man, who is depraved by idleness and bad
example, and keeping him in secure and compulsory idleness
in the society of the most depraved people? Or to
transport him, for some reason, at an expense to the government
of five hundred roubles, from the District of Tula
to the District of Irkutsk, or from Kursk&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But people seem to fear these journeys at government
expense. And were it not for these journeys, we would
not be sitting here as we are sitting now."</p>

<p>"Prisons cannot secure our safety, because people are
not imprisoned for life, but are released. On the contrary,
these institutions are the greatest breeders of vice and corruption&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
they increase the danger."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that the penitentiary system ought to
be perfected?"</p>

<p>"It cannot be perfected. Perfected prisons would cost
more than is spent on popular education and would be a
new burden on the populace."</p>

<p>"But the deficiencies of the penitentiary system do not
invalidate the judicial system," Ignatius Nikiforovitch
again continued, without listening to his brother-in-law.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>"These deficiencies cannot be corrected," said Nekhludoff,
raising his voice.</p>

<p>"What then? Would you kill? Or, as a certain statesman
suggested, pluck out their eyes?" said Ignatius Nikiforovitch,
smiling triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Yes; that would be cruel, but expedient. What we are
doing now is both cruel and inexpedient."</p>

<p>"And I am taking part in it," said Ignatius Nikiforovitch,
paling.</p>

<p>"That is your business. But I do not understand it."</p>

<p>"I think there are many things you do not understand,"
said Ignatius Nikiforovitch, with a quiver in his voice.</p>

<p>"I saw a public prosecutor in court trying his utmost to
convict an unfortunate boy, who could only arouse compassion
in any unperverted man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I thought so, I should give up my position," said
Ignatius Nikiforovitch, rising.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff noticed a peculiar glitter under his brother-in-law's
eye-glasses. "Can it be tears?" thought Nekhludoff.
They really were tears. Ignatius Nikiforovitch was
offended. Going toward the window, he drew a handkerchief
from his pocket, coughed, and began to wipe his eye-glasses,
and, removing them, he also wiped his eyes. Returning
to the couch, Ignatius Nikiforovitch lit a cigar
and spoke no more. Nekhludoff was pained and ashamed
at the grief that he had caused his brother-in-law and sister,
especially as he was leaving the next day and would
not see them again. In great agitation he took leave of
them and departed.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible that what I said was true. At any
rate, he did not refute me. But it was wrong to speak that
way. Little have I changed if I could insult him and
grieve poor Natalie," he thought.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XXII" id="CHAPTER_2-XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>The party of convicts, which included Maslova, was to
leave on the three o'clock train, and in order to see them
coming out of the prison and follow them to the railroad
station Nekhludoff decided to get to the prison before
twelve.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>While packing his clothes and papers, Nekhludoff came
across his diary and began to read the entry he had
made before leaving for St. Petersburg. "Katiusha does
not desire my sacrifice, but is willing to sacrifice herself,"
it ran. "She has conquered, and I have conquered. I
am rejoicing at that inner change which she seems to me
to be undergoing. I fear to believe it, but it appears to
me that she is awakening." Immediately after this was
the following entry: "I have lived through a very painful
and very joyous experience. I was told that she had
misbehaved in the hospital. It was very painful to hear
it. Did not think it would so affect me. Have spoken to
her with contempt and hatred, but suddenly remembered
how often I myself have been guilty&mdash;am even now,
although only in thought, of that for which I hated her,
and suddenly I was seized with disgust for myself and
pity for her, and I became very joyful. If we would only
see in time the beam in our own eye, how much kinder
we would be." Then he made the following entry for
the day: "Have seen Katiusha, and, because of my self-content,
was unkind and angry, and departed with a feeling
of oppression. But what can I do? A new life begins
to-morrow. Farewell to the old life! My mind is
filled with numberless impressions, but I cannot yet reduce
them to order."</p>

<p>On awakening the following morning, Nekhludoff's
first feeling was one of sorrow for the unpleasant incident
with his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"I must go to see them," he thought, "and smooth it
over."</p>

<p>But, looking at the clock, he saw that there was no time
left, and that he must hasten to the prison to see the
departure of the convicts. Hastily packing up his things
and sending them to the depot, Nekhludoff hired a trap
and drove to the prison.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The hot July days had set in. The stones of the
street, the houses, and the tins of the roofs, failing to
cool off during the suffocating night, exhaled their
warmth into the hot, still air. There was no breeze, and
such as rose every now and then was laden with dust and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>the stench of oil paint. The few people that were on the
streets sought shelter in the shade of the houses. Only
sun-burnt street-pavers in bast shoes were sitting in the
middle of the street, setting boulders into the hot sand;
gloomy policemen in unstarched blouses and carrying revolvers
attached to yellow cords, were lazily shuffling
about, and tram-cars with drawn blinds on the sides exposed
to the sun, and drawn by white-hooded horses, were
running up and down the street.</p>

<p>When Nekhludoff arrived at the prison, the formal delivery
and acceptance of the departing convicts, which began
at four in the morning, were still going on. The
party consisted of six hundred and twenty-three men and
sixty-four women; all had to be counted, the weak and
sick had to be separated, and they were to be delivered
to the convoy. The new inspector, two assistants, a
physician, his assistant, the officer of the convoy and a
clerk were sitting in the shade around a table with papers
and documents, calling and examining each convict and
making entries in their books.</p>

<p>One-half of the table was already exposed to the sun.
It was getting warm and close from want of air, and
from the breathing of the convicts standing near by.</p>

<p>"Will there ever be an end?" said a tall, stout, red-faced
captain of the convoy, incessantly smoking a
cigarette and blowing the smoke through the moustache
which covered his mouth. "I am exhausted. Where
have you taken so many? How many more are there?"</p>

<p>The clerk consulted the books.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four men and the women."</p>

<p>"Why are you standing there? Come forward!"
shouted the captain to the crowding convicts.</p>

<p>The convicts had already been standing three hours in
a broiling sun, waiting their turn.</p>

<p>All this was taking place in the court-yard of the prison,
while without the prison stood the usual armed soldier,
about two dozen trucks for the baggage, and the infirm
convicts, and on the corner a crowd of relatives and
friends of the convicts, waiting for a chance to see the
exiles as they emerged from the prison, and, if possible,
to have a last few words with them, or deliver some things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>they had brought for them. Nekhludoff joined this
crowd.</p>

<p>He stood there about an hour. At the end of the hour,
from behind the gates came the clatter of chains, the
tramping of feet, voices of command, coughing and the
low conversation of a large crowd. This lasted about
five minutes, during which time prison officers flitted in
and out through the wicket. Finally there was heard a
sharp command.</p>

<p>The gates were noisily flung open, the clatter of the
chains became more distinct, and a detachment of guardsmen
in white blouses and shouldering guns marched forth
and arranged themselves, evidently as a customary
man&#339;uvre, in a large semi-circle before the gates. Again
a command was heard, and the hard-labor convicts, in
pairs, began to pour out. With pancake-shaped caps on
their shaved heads, and sacks on their shoulders, they
dragged their fettered legs, holding up the sacks with
one hand and waving the other. First came the men
convicts, all in gray trousers and long coats with diamond
aces on their backs. All of them&mdash;young, old, slim, stout,
pale, and red-faced, dark-haired, moustached, bearded
and beardless, Russians, Tartars, Jews&mdash;came, clanging
their chains and briskly waving their hands as though
going on a long journey; but after making about ten steps
they stopped and humbly arranged themselves in rows
of four. Immediately behind these came another contingent,
also with shaved heads and similarly dressed,
without leg-fetters, but handcuffed to each other. These
were exiles. They walked as briskly as the others,
stopped, and formed in rows of four. Then came the
women in the same order, in gray coats and 'kerchiefs,
those sentenced to hard labor coming first; then the
exiles, and finally those voluntarily following their husbands,
in their native costumes. Some of the women carried
infants under the skirts of their coats.</p>

<p>Children&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;followed them on foot,
hanging on to the skirts of their mothers. The men stood
silently, coughing now and then, or exchanging remarks,
while the women carried on incessant conversation.
Nekhludoff thought that he saw Maslova as she was coming
out, but she was soon lost in the large crowd, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>he only saw a lot of gray creatures almost deprived of all
womanly features, with their children and sacks, grouping
themselves behind the men.</p>

<p>Although the convicts had been counted within the
walls of the prison, the guard began to count them over
again. This counting took a long time, because the convicts,
moving from one place to another, confused the
count of the officers. The officers cursed and pushed the
humbly but angrily compliant convicts and counted them
again. When the counting was finally over, the officer
of the guard gave some command, and suddenly all became
confusion in the crowd. Infirm men, women and
children hastened to the trucks, on which they first placed
their sacks, then climbed in themselves, the infants crying
in their mothers' arms, the children quarreling about the
places, the men looking gloomy and despondent.</p>

<p>Some of the convicts, removing their caps, approached
the officer and made some request. As Nekhludoff afterward
learned, they were asking to be taken on the wagons.
The guard officer, without looking at the applicants,
silently inhaled the smoke of his cigarette, then suddenly
swung his short hand at one of the convicts that approached
him, who dodged and sprang back.</p>

<p>"I will elevate you to the nobility with a rope! You
can walk!" shouted the officer.</p>

<p>Only a tall, staggering old man in irons was permitted
to ride on a wagon. The old man removed his cap, and
making the sign of the cross, dragged himself to the
wagon; but his fettered legs prevented his climbing up
until an old woman, sitting on the wagon, took his hand
and helped him in.</p>

<p>When all the wagons were loaded with sacks and those
that were permitted to ride, the guard officer uncovered
his bald head, wiped with a handkerchief his pate, forehead
and red, stout neck, made the sign of the cross, and
gave command to proceed.</p>

<p>There was a clatter of weapons; the convicts, removing
their caps, began to make the sign of the cross, some
with their left hands; the escorting crowd shouted something,
the convicts shouted in answer; a great wailing
arose among the women, and the party, surrounded by
soldiers in white blouses moved forward, raising a cloud
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>of dust with their fettered feet. They marched in the
order in which they formed at the prison gates, in rows
of four, preceded by a detachment of soldiers. The rear
was brought up by the wagons loaded with the sacks and
the infirm. On top of one of the wagons, above all
the others, sat a woman, wrapped up in her coat and
sobbing incessantly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XXIII" id="CHAPTER_2-XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>When Nekhludoff reached the railroad station the prisoners
were already seated in the cars, behind grated windows.
There were a few people on the platform, come
to see their departing relatives, but they were not allowed
to come near the cars. The guards were greatly
troubled this day. On the way from the prison to the
station five men had died from sunstroke. Three of
them had been taken to the nearest police station from
the street, while two were stricken at the railroad station.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
They were troubled not because five men had died while
under their guard. That did not bother them; but they
were chiefly concerned with doing all that the law required
them to do under the circumstances&mdash;to make
proper transfer of the dead, their papers and belongings,
and to exclude them from the list of those that were to
be transferred to Nijhni, which was very troublesome,
especially on such a warm day.</p>

<p>This it was that occupied the convoy, and this was the
reason why Nekhludoff and others were not permitted
to approach the cars while the formalities were unfinished.
However, upon bribing one of the sergeants, Nekhludoff
was permitted to come near the cars, the sergeant asking
him to do his errand so that the captain would not see
him. There were eighteen cars, and all, except the one
reserved for the authorities, were literally packed with
prisoners. Passing by the windows, Nekhludoff listened
to the sounds within. Everywhere he heard the rattling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>of chains, bustle, and the hum of conversation, interspersed
with stupid profanity; but nowhere did he hear,
as he expected, any reference to the dead comrades.
Their conversation related more to sacks, drinking-water,
and the choice of seats. Looking into the window of one
of the cars, Nekhludoff saw some guardsmen removing
the handcuffs from the wrists of the prisoners. The prisoners
stretched out their hands, while one of the guards
with a key opened the locks of the handcuffs, which were
collected by another. When Nekhludoff reached the
second car occupied by the women he heard a woman's
moan, "Oh, heavens! Oh, heavens!"</p>

<p>Nekhludoff passed by and approached one of the windows
of the third car, pointed out to him by one of the
guards. Overheated air, impregnated with a thick odor
of perspiration, assailed his nostrils, and shrill women's
voices were distinctly heard. All the benches were occupied
by flushed, perspiring women in waists and coats,
loudly conversing. His approach attracted their attention.
Those sitting nearest to the grated window became
silent. Maslova, in a waist and without headgear, was
sitting near the opposite window. The smiling Theodosia,
who was sitting near Maslova, seeing Nekhludoff,
pushed her with her elbow and pointed to Nekhludoff.
Maslova hurriedly rose, threw a 'kerchief over her black
hair, and, with an animated, red, perspiring and smiling
face, came near the window and placed her hands on
the grating.</p>

<p>"But how warm it is!" she said, smiling joyously.</p>

<p>"Did you get the things?"</p>

<p>"I did, thank you."</p>

<p>"Do you need anything?" asked Nekhludoff, feeling the
heat issuing from the window as from a steam bath.</p>

<p>"I do not need anything. Thank you."</p>

<p>"If we could only get some water," said Theodosia.</p>

<p>"Yes, some water," repeated Maslova.</p>

<p>"I will ask one of the guards," said Nekhludoff. "We
will not meet now until we reach Nijhni."</p>

<p>"Why, are you going there?" she said, as if she did not
know it, but joyously glancing at Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I am going on the next train."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>Maslova was silent for a few moments; then sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>"Is it true, master, that twelve people have died from
the heat?" said a churlish old woman in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>It was Korableva.</p>

<p>"I don't know that twelve have died. I have seen two,"
said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"They say twelve. They ought to be punished for it,
the devils!"</p>

<p>"How is it with the women?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Women are stronger," said another prisoner, smiling.
"Only there is one who has taken it into her head to give
birth to a child. Listen to her wailing," she said, pointing
to the adjacent car, from which the moaning proceeded.</p>

<p>"You asked if anything was needed," said Maslova, endeavoring
to restrain a happy smile. "Could not that
woman be taken off the train? She suffers so. Won't
you tell the authorities?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"Another thing&mdash;could you not get her to see her husband,
Tarass?" she added, pointing to the smiling Theodosia.
"He is going with you, isn't he?"</p>

<p>At this point the voice of a sergeant was heard reminding
Nekhludoff that talking with the prisoners was prohibited.
It was not the sergeant who passed Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff walked off to find the captain, intending to
see him about the sick woman and Tarass, but for a long
time could not find him, the guards being too busy to
answer his inquiries. Some were leading away one of
the convicts; others were hurrying away to buy their
provisions; still others were attending a lady who was
traveling with the captain of the convoy.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff found the captain after the second bell.
The captain, wiping his thick moustache with his short
hand and raising his shoulders, was reprimanding one of
the sergeants.</p>

<p>"What is it you want?" he asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"There is a woman giving birth to a child, so I thought
it would be well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let her. When the child is born we will see
to it," said the captain, passing to his car.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>The conductor came with a whistle in his hand. The
third bell sounded, and a loud wailing rose among the
female prisoners and their friends and relatives on the
platform. Nekhludoff was standing beside Tarass, and
watched the cars passing before him, with the grated windows
and the shaved heads seen through them. As the
one in which Maslova was passed, he saw her standing
with others at the window, looking at him and smiling
piteously.</p>

<p>The passenger train which was to carry away Nekhludoff
was to start in two hours. Nekhludoff at first
thought of utilizing these two hours in visiting his sister,
but after the impressions of the morning he felt so excited
and exhausted that he seated himself on a sofa in
the saloon for first-class passengers. But he unexpectedly
felt so drowsy that he turned on his side, placed his
palm under his cheek, and immediately fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened by a servant in dress-coat holding a
napkin in his hand.</p>

<p>"Mister, mister, are you not Prince Nekhludoff? A
lady is looking for you."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff quickly raised himself, rubbing his eyes,
and the incidents of the morning passed before his mind's
eye&mdash;the procession of the convicts, the men who had
died from the heat, the grated windows of the cars, and
the women huddled behind them, one of whom was laboring
in child-birth without aid, and another piteously
smiling to him from behind the iron grating. But in
reality he saw a table covered with bottles, vases, chandeliers,
and fruit stands; nimble servants bustling around
the table, and in the depth of the saloon, before the lunch-counter,
loaded with viands and fruits, the backs of passengers
leisurely eating their luncheon.</p>

<p>While Nekhludoff was raising himself and shaking off
the slumber, he noticed that everybody in the saloon was
curiously watching the entrance. He turned his eyes in
the same direction, and saw a procession of people who
bore an arm-chair in which was seated a lady, her head
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>covered with tulle. The first bearer was a lackey who
seemed familiar to Nekhludoff. The one behind was also
a familiar porter, with white crown lace around his cap.
Behind the arm-chair came an elegantly dressed maid-servant
with curly hair, carrying a round leather box and
a sunshade. Further behind came the short-necked
Prince Korchagin, his shoulders thrown back; then
Missy, Misha, their cousin, and a diplomat Osten, unfamiliar
to Nekhludoff, with his long neck and prominent
Adam's apple and an ever cheerful appearance. He
walked impressively, but evidently jestingly talking to
the smiling Missy. Behind them came the doctor, angrily
smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>The Korchagins were moving from their estate to the
Prince's sister, whose estate was situated on the Nijhni
road.</p>

<p>The procession passed into the ladies' room. The old
Prince, however, seating himself at the table, immediately
called over a waiter and began to order something.
Missy with Osten also stopped in the dining-room, and
were about to sit down when they saw an acquaintance
in the doorway and went to meet her. It was Natalia
Ivanovna. She was escorted by Agrippina Petrovna, and
as she entered the dining-room she looked around. At
almost the same moment she noticed Missy and her
brother. She first approached Missy, only nodding her
head to Nekhludoff. But after kissing Missy she immediately
turned to him.</p>

<p>"At last I have found you," she said.</p>

<p>After greeting his sister, Nekhludoff entered into conversation
with Missy, who told him that their house had
burned down, necessitating their removal to her aunt's.
Osten began to relate a droll anecdote anent the fire.
Nekhludoff, without listening to Osten, turned to his
sister:</p>

<p>"How glad I am that you came!"</p>

<p>In the course of their conversation he told her how
sorry he felt for having fallen out with her husband; that
he had intended to return and confess that he was at fault,
but that he knew not how her husband would take it.</p>

<p>"I spoke improperly to him, and it tortured me," he
said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>"I knew it. I was sure you didn't intend it," said his
sister. "Don't you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tears welled up in her eyes, and she touched her
brother's hand. It was spoken tenderly; he understood
her, and was affected. The meaning of her words was
that, besides her love for her husband, her love for her
brother was dear and important to her, and that any disagreement
with him caused her suffering.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you. Oh, what I have seen to-day!"
he said, suddenly recalling the two dead convicts.
"Two convicts have been killed."</p>

<p>"How killed?"</p>

<p>"So, simply killed. They have been brought here in
this heat, and two of them died from sunstroke."</p>

<p>"Impossible! How? To-day? Just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just now. I have seen their corpses."</p>

<p>"Why were they killed? Who killed them?" asked
Natalia Ivanovna.</p>

<p>"Those who forcibly brought them here," said Nekhludoff
excitedly, feeling that she took the same view of this
as her husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" said Agrippina Petrovna, coming nearer
to them.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have no conception of the life these unfortunates
are leading, and it is necessary to know it," Nekhludoff
added, looking at the old Prince, who, sitting at
the table with a napkin tucked under his chin and a large
glass before him, at that moment glanced at Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Nekhludoff," he shouted. "Won't you take sauce to
cool off? It is excellent stuff."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff refused and turned away.</p>

<p>"But what will you do?" continued Natalia Ivanovna.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can. I do not know what, but I feel
that I must do something. And I will do what I can."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand that. And what about him?"
she said, smiling and nodding in the direction of Korchagin.
"Is it really all over?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is and I think without regret on either side."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry. I like her. But I suppose it must
be so. But why should you bind yourself? Why are
you following her?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>"Because it is proper that I should," Nekhludoff said
dryly, as though desiring to change the subject.</p>

<p>But he immediately felt ashamed of his coldness to his
sister. "Why should I not tell her what I think?" he
thought; "and let Agrippina Petrovna also know it," he
said to himself, looking at the old servant.</p>

<p>The presence of Agrippina Petrovna only encouraged
him to repeat his decision to his sister.</p>

<p>"You are speaking of my intention to marry Katiusha.
You see, I have decided to do it, but she firmly and decidedly
refused me," he said, and his voice trembled, as it
always did when he spoke of it. "She does not desire
my sacrifice, and in her position she sacrifices very much,
and I could not accept her sacrifice, even if it were only
momentary. That is why I am following her, and I will
be near her, and will endeavor to relieve her condition
as far as I am able."</p>

<p>Natalia Ivanovna was silent. Agrippina Petrovna
looked inquiringly at Natalia Ivanovna, shaking her head.
At that moment the procession started again from the
ladies' room. The same handsome Phillip and the porter
were bearing the Princess. She stopped the bearers,
beckoned Nekhludoff to her side, and in a piteously languid
manner extended her white, ring-bedecked hand,
with horror anticipating the hard pressure of his.</p>

<p>"<i>Epouvantable!</i>" she said of the heat. "It is unbearable.
<i>Ce climat me tue.</i>" And having said a few words
of the horrors of the Russian climate, and invited Nekhludoff
to visit them, she gave a sign to the bearers.
"Don't fail to come, now," she added, turning her long
face to Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff went out on the platform. The procession
turned to the right, toward the first-class coaches. Nekhludoff,
with a porter who carried his baggage, and Tarass,
with his bags, turned to the left.</p>

<p>"That is my comrade," Nekhludoff said to his sister,
pointing to Tarass, whose story he had told her before.</p>

<p>"What, are you taking the third class?" asked Natalia
Ivanovna, when Nekhludoff stopped before a third-class
car and the porter, with Tarass, entered it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will have it more convenient then. Tarass is
with me. Another thing," he added. "I have not yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>given the <a name="Kusminsk" id="Kusminsk"></a>Kusminskoie land to the peasants. So that, in
case of my death, your children will inherit it."</p>

<p>"Dmitri, don't talk that way," said Natalia Ivanovna.</p>

<p>"And if I do give it away, then all I have to tell you
is that the remainder will be theirs, for I shall hardly
marry. And if I do, there will be no children&mdash;so
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dmitri, please stop it," said Natalia Ivanovna; but
Nekhludoff saw that she was glad to hear what he was
saying.</p>

<p>The time for parting had come. The conductors were
closing the doors, inviting the passengers to take seats,
others to leave the cars.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff entered the heated and ill-smelling car and
immediately appeared on its platform. Natalia Ivanovna
was standing opposite, and evidently wished to say something,
but could not find words. She could not say
"<i>ecrivez</i>," because they had long been ridiculing the customary
phrase of parting friends. The conversation
about financial affairs and the inheritance at once destroyed
the tender relations they had resumed. They
now felt themselves estranged from each other. So that
Natalia Ivanovna was glad when the train began to
move and she could say, with a smile: "Well, Dmitri,
good-by!" As soon as the train left she began to think
how to tell her husband of her conversation with her
brother, and her face became grave and worried.</p>

<p>And though Nekhludoff entertained the best sentiments
toward his sister, and he concealed nothing from her, he
now felt estranged from her, and was glad to be rid of
her. He felt that the Natasha of old was no more; that
there was only a slave of an unpleasant, dark, hairy man
with whom he had nothing in common. He plainly saw
this, because her face became illumined with peculiar animation
only when he spoke of that which interested her
husband&mdash;of the distribution of the land among the peasants,
and of the inheritance. This made him sad.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2-XXV" id="CHAPTER_2-XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>


<p>The heat in the large car of the third class, due to its
exposure to the scorching sun rays and the large crowd
within, was so suffocating that Nekhludoff remained on
the platform. But there was no relief even there, and he
drew in long breaths when the train rolled out beyond
the houses and the movement of the train created a
draught. "Yes, killed," he repeated to himself. And to
his imagination appeared with unusual vividness the
beautiful face of the second dead convict, with a smile
on his lips, the forbidding expression of his forehead, and
the small, strong ear under the shaved, bluish scalp.
"And the worst part of it is that he was killed, and no
one knows who killed him. Yet he was killed. He was
forwarded, like the others, at the order of Maslenikoff.
Maslenikoff probably signed the usual order with his
foolish flourish, on a printed letter-head, and, of course,
does not consider himself guilty. The prison physician,
who inspected the convicts, has still less reason for considering
himself guilty. He carefully fulfilled his duties,
separated the weak ones, and could not possibly foresee
either the terrible heat, or that they would be taken away
so late and in such a crowd. The inspector? But the
inspector only carried out the order that on such a day
so many men and women prisoners should be sent away.
No more guilty was the officer of the convoy, whose duty
consisted in receiving so many people at such a place and
delivering them at another place. He led the party in
the usual way, according to instructions, and could not
possibly foresee that such strong men, like the two whom
Nekhludoff had seen, would succumb and die. No one
was guilty, and yet the men were killed by these very
people who were innocent of their death.</p>

<p>"All this happened," thought Nekhludoff, "because all
those people&mdash;the governor, inspector and the other officers&mdash;saw
before them, not human beings and their duties
toward them, but the service and its requirements.
Therein lies the difficulty."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>In his meditation Nekhludoff did not notice how the
weather had changed. The sun had hidden behind a low
strip of cloud, and from the southern sky a light-gray
mass, from which a slanting rain was already pouring in
the distance over the fields and forests, was coming on.
Now and then a flash of lightning rent the clouds, and
the rattle of the train mingled with the rattle of thunder.
The clouds came nearer and nearer, the slanting drops
of rain, driven by the wind, pattered on the platform of
the car and stained Nekhludoff's overcoat. He moved
to the other side, and drawing in the fresh, humid air
and the odor of the wheat coming from the parched
ground, he looked on the passing gardens, forests; the rye
fields just turning yellow, the emerald streaks of oats,
and the furrows of the dark-green, flowering potato.
Everything looked as if covered with varnish: the green
and yellow colors became brighter; the black became
blacker.</p>

<p>"More, more," said Nekhludoff, rejoicing at the reviving
fields and gardens under the abundant rain.</p>

<p>The heavy rain did not last long. The clouds partly
dissipated, and the last fine shower fell straight on the wet
ground. The sun came forth again, the earth brightened,
and a low but brilliant violet tinged rainbow, broken
at one end, appeared in the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>"What was I thinking of?" Nekhludoff asked himself,
when all these changes of nature came to an end and
the train descended into a vale. "Yes, I was thinking
that all those people&mdash;the inspector, the guard and all
those servants, for the most part gentle, kind people&mdash;have
become wicked."</p>

<p>He recalled the indifference of Maslenikoff when he
told the latter of what was going on in the prison, of the
severity of the inspector, the cruelty of the sergeant who
refused the use of the wagons to the weak convicts and
paid no attention to the suffering of the woman in child-birth.
All those people were evidently proof against the
feeling of sympathy, "as is this paved ground against
rain," he thought, looking at the incline paved with multi-colored
stone, from which the water streamed off. "May
be it is necessary to lay the stones on the incline, but it
is sad to see the soil deprived of vegetation when it could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>be made to grow grain, grass, shrubs and trees like those
seen on those heights. It is the same with people,"
thought Nekhludoff. "The whole trouble lies in that
people think that there are conditions excluding the necessity
of love in their intercourse with man, but such conditions
do not exist. Things may be treated without
love; one may chop wood, make bricks, forge iron without
love, but one can no more deal with people without
love than one can handle bees without care. The nature
of bees is such that if you handle them carelessly you
will harm them as well as yourself. It is the same with
people. And it cannot be different, because mutual love
is the basic law of human life. True, man cannot compel
himself to love, as he can compel himself to work, but
it does not follow from this that in his dealings with men
he can leave love out of consideration, especially if he
wants something from them. If you feel no love for
people, then keep away from them," Nekhludoff said to
himself. "Occupy yourself with things, yourself&mdash;anything;
only keep away from people. As it is harmful
to eat except when one is hungry, so is it harmful to
have intercourse with people when one does not love
them. If one permits himself to deal with people without
having any love for them, as I did yesterday with
my brother-in-law, there is no limit to the cruelty and
brutality one is liable to display toward others, as I have
seen to-day, and there is no limit to one's own suffering,
as I have learned from all the experiences of my own
life. Yes, yes, that is so," thought Nekhludoff, experiencing
the double pleasure of a cool breeze after the intolerable
heat, and the consciousness of having reached
the highest degree of lucidity in the question which had
so long occupied him.</p>

<p>The party of convicts to which Maslova belonged had
gone about thirty-five hundred miles. It was not until
Perm was reached that Nekhludoff succeeded in obtaining
Maslova's transfer to the contingent of politicals, as
he was advised to do by Bogodukhovskaia, who was
among them.</p>

<p>The journey to Perm was very burdensome to Maslova,
both physically and morally&mdash;physically because of
the crowded condition of their quarters, the uncleanliness
and disgusting insects, which gave her no rest; morally
because of the equally loathsome men who, though
they changed at every stopping place, were like the insects,
always insolent, intrusive and gave her little rest.
The cynicism prevailing among the convicts and their
overseers was such that every woman, especially the
young women, had to be on the alert. Maslova was particularly
subject to these attacks because of her attractive
looks and her well-known past. This condition of constant
dread and struggle was very burdensome to her.
The firm repulse with which she met the impertinent advances
of the men was taken by them as an insult and
exasperated them. Her condition in this respect was
somewhat relieved by the presence of Theodosia and
<a name="Tarass" id="Tarass"></a>Tarass, who, learning that his wife was subjected to these
insults, had himself included among the prisoners, and
riding as such from Nijhni, was able to protect her to
some extent.</p>

<p>Maslova's transfer to the division of the politicals bettered
her situation in every respect. Besides the improvement
in the quarters, food and treatment, her condition
was also made easier by the fact that the persecution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>of the men ceased and she was no longer reminded
of her past, which she was so anxious to forget now.
The principal advantage of the transfer, however, lay in
the acquaintance she made of some people who exerted a
decisive influence over her.</p>

<p>At stopping places she was permitted to mingle with
the politicals, but, being a strong woman, she was compelled
to walk with the other prisoners. She thus walked
from Tomsk. There were two politicals who traveled on
foot with her&mdash;Maria Pablovna Stchetinina, the same
pretty girl with the sheepish eyes who had attracted
Nekhludoff's attention when visiting Bogodukhovskaia,
and one Simonson, banished to Yakoutsk&mdash;that same
shaggy man with deep-set eyes whom Nekhludoff had noticed
on the same occasion. Maria Pablovna walked, because
she yielded her place on the wagon to a pregnant
woman; Simonson, because he would not profit by class
advantages. These three started on foot with the other
convicts in the early morning, the politicals following
them later in wagons. It was at the last stopping place,
near a large city, where the party was handed over to
another convoy officer.</p>

<p>It was a chill September morning. Snow and rain
fell alternately between cold blasts of wind. All the
prisoners&mdash;400 men and 50 women&mdash;were already in the
court-yard, some crowding around the chief officer of the
convoy, who was paying out money to the overseers for
the day's rations; others were buying food of the hucksters
who had been admitted into the court-yard. There
were a din of prisoners' voices counting money and the
shrill conversation of the hucksters.</p>

<p>Katiousha and Maria Pablovna, both in boots and short
fur coats and girdled with 'kerchiefs, came into the court-yard
from the house and walked toward the hucksters,
who were sitting under the northern wall and calling out
their wares&mdash;fresh meat-pies, fish, boiled shred paste,
buckwheat mush, meat, eggs, milk; one woman even offered
roasted pig.</p>

<p>Simonson, in rubber jacket and similar galoshes, bound
with whip-cord over woolen socks (he was a vegetarian
and did not use the skin of animals), was also awaiting
the departure of the party. He stood near the entrance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>of the house, writing down in a note-book a thought that
occurred to him. "If," he wrote, "a bacterium were to
observe and analyze the nail of a man, it would declare
him an inorganic being. Similarly, from an observation
of the earth's surface, we declare it to be inorganic. That
is wrong."</p>

<p>Having bought eggs, buns, fish and fresh wheat bread,
Maslova packed them away in a bag while Maria Pablovna
settled for the food, when among the prisoners
there arose a commotion. Every one became silent, and
the prisoners began to form into ranks. An officer came
forth and gave final orders.</p>

<p>Everything proceeded as usual&mdash;the prisoners were
counted over, the chains were examined and men were
handcuffed in pairs.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-II" id="CHAPTER_3-II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>After six years of luxurious and pampered life in the
city and two months in prison among the politicals, her
present life, notwithstanding the hard conditions, seemed
to Katiousha very satisfactory. The journeys of fifteen
or twenty miles on foot between stopping places, the food
and day's rest after two days' tramp, strengthened her
physically, while her association with her new comrades
opened up to her new phases of life of which she had
formerly no conception.</p>

<p>She was charmed with all her new comrades. But above
all, with Maria Pablovna&mdash;nay, she even came to love
her with a respectful and exulting love. She was struck
by the fact that a beautiful girl of a rich and noble family,
and speaking three languages, should conduct herself like
a common workingwoman, distribute everything sent her
by her rich brother, dress herself not only simply, but
poorly, and pay no attention to her appearance. This entire
absence of coquetry surprised and completely captivated
Maslova. She saw that Maria Pablovna knew, and
that it even pleased her to know, that she was pretty, but
that so far from rejoicing at the impression she was making
on the men, she only feared it, and rather looked at
love with disgust and dread. If her male comrades, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>knew her, felt any attraction toward her they never
showed it. But strangers often attempted familiarities
with her, and in such cases her great physical strength
stood her in good stead. "Once," she laughingly related,
"I was approached by a stranger on the street, whom I
could not get rid of. I then gave him such a shaking up
that he ran away in fright."</p>

<p>She also said that from childhood she had felt an aversion
for the life of the gentry, but loved the common folks,
and was often chidden for staying in the servants' quarters,
the kitchen and the stable, instead of the parlor.</p>

<p>"But among the cooks and drivers I was always cheerful,
while our ladies and gentlemen used to worry me.
Afterward, when I began to understand, I saw that we
were leading a wicked life. I had no mother, and I did
not like my father. At nineteen I left the house with a
girl friend and went to work in a factory," she said.</p>

<p>From the factory she went to the country, then returned
to the city, where she was arrested and sentenced to hard
labor. Maria Pablovna never related it herself, but Katiousha
learned from others that she was sentenced to
hard labor because she assumed the guilt of another.</p>

<p>Since Katiousha came to know her she saw that Maria
Pablovna, everywhere and under all circumstances, never
thought of herself, but was always occupied in helping
some one else. One of her present comrades, jesting, said
of her that she had given herself up to the sport of charity.
And that was true. Like a sportsman looking for game,
her entire activity consisted in finding occasion for serving
others. And this sport became a habit with her, her
life's aim. And she did it so naturally that all those that
knew her ceased to appreciate it, and demanded it as by
right.</p>

<p>When Maslova entered their ranks, Maria Pablovna
felt a disgust and loathing for her. Katiousha noticed it.
But she also noticed afterward that Maria Pablovna,
making some effort, became particularly kind and gentle
toward her. The kindness and gentleness of such an uncommon
person so affected Maslova that she gave herself
up to her with her whole soul, unconsciously acquired her
glance and involuntarily imitated her in everything.</p>

<p>They were also drawn together by that disgust which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>both felt toward physical love. The one hated it, because
she had experienced all the horror of it; the other, because
not having experienced it, she looked upon it as
something strange and at the same time disgusting and
offensive to human dignity.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-III" id="CHAPTER_3-III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>The influence exerted by Maria Pablovna over Katiousha
was due to the fact that Katiousha loved Maria Pablovna.
There was another influence&mdash;that of Simonson,
and that was due to the fact that Simonson loved Katiousha.</p>

<p>Simonson decided everything by the light of his reason,
and having once decided upon a thing, he never
swerved. While yet a student he made up his mind that
the wealth of his father, who was an officer of the Commissary
Department, was dishonestly accumulated. He
then declared to him that his wealth ought to be returned
to the people. And when he was reprimanded he left the
house and refused to avail himself of his father's means.
Having come to the conclusion that all evil can be traced
to the people's ignorance, he joined the Democrats, on
leaving the university, and obtaining the position of village
teacher, he boldly preached before his pupils and the
peasants that which he considered to be just, and denounced
that which he considered unjust and false.</p>

<p>He was arrested and prosecuted.</p>

<p>During the trial he decided that the court had no right
to judge him, and said so. The judges disagreeing with
him and proceeding with the trial, he concluded not to answer
their questions and remained silent. He was sentenced
to exile in the Government of Archangel. There
he formulated a religious creed defining all his actions.
According to this religious teaching nothing in the world
is dead, there is life in everything; all those things which
we consider dead, inorganic, are but parts of a huge organic
body which we cannot embrace, and that, as a part
of a huge organism, man's aim should be to conserve the
life of that organism and the lives of all its parts. He
therefore considered it a crime to destroy life; was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>against war, executions, the killing in any manner not
only of human beings, but of animals. He also had his
theory of marriage, according to which the breeding of
people was man's lower function, his higher function consisting
in conserving life already existing. He found
confirmation of this idea in the existence of phagocites in
the blood. Bachelors, according to him, were the same
phagocites whose function was to help the weak, sickly
parts of the organism. And true to his convictions, he
had been performing this function since he became convinced
of the truth of the theory, although as a youth he
had led a different life. He called himself, as well as
Maria Pablovna, a phagocite of the world.</p>

<p>His love for Katiousha did not violate this theory, since
it was purely platonic. He assumed that such love not
only did not prevent his phagocite activity, but aided it.</p>

<p>And it was this man who, falling in love with Katiousha,
had a decisive influence over her. With the instincts of
a woman, Maslova soon discovered it, and the consciousness
that she could arouse the feeling of love in such a
remarkable man raised her in her own estimation. Nekhludoff
offered to marry her out of magnanimity, and the
obligation for the past, but Simonson loved her as she was
now, and loved her simply because he loved her. She
felt, besides, that he considered her an unusual woman,
distinguished from all other women, and possessing high
moral qualities. She did not know exactly what those
qualities were, but, at all events, not to deceive him, she
endeavored with all her power to call forth her best qualities
and, necessarily, be as good as she could be.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-IV" id="CHAPTER_3-IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff managed to see Maslova only twice between
Nijhni and Perm&mdash;once in Nijhni while the prisoners were
being placed on a net-covered lighter, and again in the office
of the Perm prison. On both occasions he found her
secretive and unkind. When he asked her about her
prison conditions, or whether she wanted anything, she
became confused and answered evasively and, as it seemed
to him, with that hostile feeling of reproach which she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>had manifested before. And this gloomy temper, due
only to the persecutions to which she was being subjected
by the men, tormented him.</p>

<p>But at their very first meeting in Tomsk she became
again as she was before her departure. She no longer
frowned or became confused when she saw him, but, on
the contrary, met him cheerfully and simply, thanking him
for what he had done for her, especially for bringing her
in contact with her present company.</p>

<p>After two months of journey from prison to prison, this
change also manifested itself in her appearance. She became
thin, sun-burnt and apparently older; wrinkles appeared
on her temples and around her mouth; she no
longer curled her hair on her forehead, but wore a 'kerchief
on her head, and neither in her dress, coiffure, nor in
her conduct were there any signs of her former coquetry.
And this change called forth in Nekhludoff a particularly
joyous feeling. The feeling he now experienced toward
her was unlike any he had experienced before. It had
nothing in common with his first poetic impulse, nor with
that sentimental love which he felt afterward, nor even
with that consciousness of a duty performed, coupled with
self-admiration, which impelled him, after the trial, to resolve
on marrying her. It was that same simple feeling
of pity and contrition which he experienced at their first
meeting in the prison and afterward, with greater force,
when he conquered his disgust and forgave her conduct
with the physician's assistant in the hospital (the injustice
he had done her had subsequently become plain). It was
the same feeling with the difference that, while it was
temporary then, now it was permanent.</p>

<p>During this period, because of Maslova's transfer to
the politicals, Nekhludoff became acquainted with many
political prisoners. On closer acquaintance he was convinced
that they were not all villains, as many people
imagined them to be, nor all heroes, as some of them considered
the members of their party, but that they were
ordinary people, among whom, as in other parties, some
were good, some bad, the others indifferent.</p>

<p>He became particularly attached to a consumptive
young man who was on his way to a life term at hard labor.
The story of the young man was a very short one.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>His father, a rich Southern landlord, died while he was
a child. He was the only son, and was brought up by his
mother. He was the best scholar in the university, making
his specialty mathematics. He was offered a chair in
the university and a course abroad. But he hesitated.
There was a girl of whom he became enamored, so he
contemplated marriage and political activity. He wished
everything, but resolved on nothing. At that time his
college chums asked him for money for a common cause.
He knew what that common cause was, and at the time
took no interest in it whatever, but from a feeling of fellowship
and egoism gave the money, that it might not be
thought that he was afraid. Those who took the money
were arrested; a note was found from which it was
learned that the money had been given by Kryltzoff. He
was arrested, taken to the police station, then to the
prison.</p>

<p>After his discharge he traveled now South, now to St.
Petersburg, then abroad, and again to Kieff and to Odessa.
He was denounced by a man in whom he placed
great faith. He was arrested, tried, kept in prison two
years and finally death sentence was imposed on him, but
was afterward commuted to hard labor for life.</p>

<p>He was stricken with consumption while in prison, and
under the present circumstances had but a few months to
live, and he knew it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-V" id="CHAPTER_3-V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>At last Nekhludoff succeeded in obtaining permission
to visit Maslova in her cell among the politicals.</p>

<p>While passing the dimly-lighted court-yard from the officers'
headquarters to "No. 5," escorted by a messenger,
he heard a stir and buzzing of voices coming from the
one-story dwelling occupied by the prisoners. And when
he came nearer and the door was opened, the buzzing increased
and turned into a Babel of shouting, cursing and
laughing. A rattling of chains was heard, and a familiar
noisome air was wafted from the doorway. The din of
voices with the rattle of chains, and the dreadful odor always
produced in Nekhludoff the tormenting feeling of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>some moral nausea, turning into physical nausea. These
two impressions, mingling, strengthened each other.</p>

<p>The apartment occupied by the political prisoners consisted
of two small cells, the doors of which opened into
the corridor, partitioned off from the rest. As Nekhludoff
got beyond the partition he noticed Simonson feeding
a billet of pine wood into the oven.</p>

<p>Spying Nekhludoff he looked up without rising and extended
his hand.</p>

<p>"I am glad you came; I want to see you!" he said, with
a significant glance, looking Nekhludoff straight in the
eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I will tell you later; I am busy now."</p>

<p>And Simonson again occupied himself with making the
fire, which he did according to his special theory of the
greatest conservation of heat energy.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff was about to enter the first door when Maslova,
broom in hand, and sweeping a heap of dirt and dust
toward the oven, emerged from the second door. She
wore a white waist and white stockings and her skirt was
tucked up under the waist. A white 'kerchief covered her
head to her very eyebrows. Seeing Nekhludoff, she unbent
herself and, all red and animated, put aside the
broom, and wiping her hands on her skirt, she stood still.</p>

<p>"You are putting things in order?" asked Nekhludoff,
extending his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, my old occupation," she answered and smiled.
"There is such dirt here; there is no end to our cleaning."</p>

<p>"Well, is the plaid dry?" she turned to Simonson.</p>

<p>"Almost," said Simonson, glancing at her in a manner
which struck Nekhludoff as very peculiar.</p>

<p>"Then I will fetch the furs to dry. All our people are
there," she said to Nekhludoff, going to the further room
and pointing to the nearest door.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff opened the door and walked into a small
cell, dimly lighted by a little metallic lamp standing on a
low bunk. The cell was cold and there was an odor of
dust, dampness and tobacco. The tin lamp threw a
bright light on those around it, but the bunks were in the
shade and vacillating shadows moved along the walls. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>the small room were all the prisoners, except two men
who had gone for boiling water and provisions. There
was an old acquaintance of Nekhludoff, the yellow-faced
and thin Vera Efremovna, with her large, frightened eyes
and a big vein on her forehead. She was sitting nervously
rolling cigarettes from a heap of tobacco lying on a
newspaper in front of her.</p>

<p>In the far corner there was also Maria Pablovna.</p>

<p>"How opportune your coming! How you seen
Katia?" she asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>There was also Anatolie Kryltzoff. Pale and wasted,
his legs crossed under him, bending forward and shivering,
he sat in the far corner, his hands hidden in the
sleeves of his fur jacket, and with feverish eyes looked at
Nekhludoff. Nekhludoff was about to approach him, but
to the right of the entrance, sorting something in a bag
and talking to the pretty and smiling Grabetz, sat a man
with curly red hair, in a rubber jacket and with spectacles.
His name was Novodvoroff, and Nekhludoff hastened
to greet him. Of all political prisoners, Nekhludoff
liked him best. Novodvoroff glanced over his spectacles
at Nekhludoff and, frowning, he extended his thin hand.</p>

<p>"Well, are you enjoying your journey?" he said, evidently
in irony.</p>

<p>"Yes, there are many interesting things," answered
Nekhludoff, pretending not to see the irony, and treating
it as a civility. Then he went over to Kryltzoff. In appearance
Nekhludoff seemed to be indifferent, but in reality
he was far from being so to Novodvoroff. These
words of Novodvoroff, and his evident desire to say something
unpleasant, jarred upon his kindly sentiments, and
he became gloomy and despondent.</p>

<p>"Well, how is your health?" he said, pressing Kryltzoff's
cold and trembling hand.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair, only I cannot get warm; I am all wet,"
said Kryltzoff, hastily hiding his hand in the sleeve of his
coat. "Those windows are broken." He pointed to the
windows behind the iron gratings. "Why did you not
come before?"</p>

<p>Expecting to have a private conversation with Katiousha,
Nekhludoff sat conversing with Kryltzoff. Kryltzoff
listened attentively, fixedly gazing at Nekhludoff.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>"Yes," he said, suddenly, "I have often thought that we
were going into exile with those very people on account
of whom we were banished. And yet we not only do not
know them, but do not wish to know them. And, worse
of all, they hate us and consider us their enemies. This
is dreadful."</p>

<p>"There is nothing dreadful about it," said Novodvoroff,
overhearing the conversation. "The masses are always
churlish and ignorant."</p>

<p>At that moment there was an outburst of curses behind
the partition wall, followed by a jostling and banging
against walls, a clatter of chains, screaming and shouting.
Some one was being beaten; some one shouted "Help!"</p>

<p>"See those beasts! What have they in common with
us?" calmly asked Novodvoroff.</p>

<p>"You call them beasts, but you should have heard Nekhludoff
telling of the conduct of one of them," Kryltzoff
said excitedly.</p>

<p>"You are sentimental!" Novodvoroff said, ironically.
"It is hard for us to understand the emotions of these
people and the motives of their acts. Where you see
magnanimity, there may only be envy."</p>

<p>"Why is it you do not wish to see good in others?"
said Maria Pablovna, suddenly becoming excited.</p>

<p>"I cannot see that which does not exist."</p>

<p>"How can you say it does not exist when a man risks a
terrible death?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Novodvoroff, "that if we wish to serve
our cause effectively it is necessary that we stop dreaming
and look at things as they are. We must do
everything for the masses, and expect nothing from
them. The masses are the object of our activity, but
they cannot be our collaborators while they are as inert
as they are now. And it is, therefore, perfectly illusive
to expect aid from them before they have gone through
the process of development&mdash;that process of development
for which we are preparing them."</p>

<p>"What process of development?" said Kryltzoff, becoming
red in the face. "We say that we are against the
use of force, but is this not force in its worst form?"</p>

<p>"There is no force here," calmly said Novodvoroff. "I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>only said that I know the path the people must follow,
and can point it out."</p>

<p>"But how do you know that yours is the right path?
Is it not the same despotism which gave rise to the Inquisition
and the executions of the Great Revolution?
They, too, knew the only scientific path."</p>

<p>"The fact that people erred does not prove that I am
erring. Besides, there is a great difference between the
ravings of ideologists and the data of positive economic
science."</p>

<p>Novodvoroff's voice filled the entire cell. He alone was
speaking; all the others were silent.</p>

<p>"Those eternal discussions!" said Maria Pablovna at a
momentary lull.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of it?" Nekhludoff asked
Maria Pablovna.</p>

<p>"I think that Anatolie is right&mdash;that we have no right
to force our ideas on the people."</p>

<p>"That is a strange conception of our ideas," said Novodvoroff,
and he began to smoke angrily.</p>

<p>"I cannot talk to them," <a name="Kryltzoff" id="Kryltzoff"></a>Kryltzoff said in a whisper, and
became silent.</p>

<p>"And it is much better not to talk," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-VI" id="CHAPTER_3-VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>An officer entered the cell and announced that the time
for departing had arrived. He counted every prisoner,
pointing at every one with his finger. When he reached
Nekhludoff he said, familiarly:</p>

<p>"It is too late to remain now, Prince; it is time to go."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff, knowing what that meant, approached him
and thrust three rubles into his hand.</p>

<p>"Nothing can be done with you&mdash;stay here a while
longer."</p>

<p>Simonson, who was all the while silently sitting on
his bunk, his hands clasped behind his head, firmly arose,
and carefully making his way through those sitting
around the bunk, went over to Nekhludoff.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>"Can you hear me now?" asked Simonson.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Nekhludoff, also rising to follow him.</p>

<p>Maslova saw Nekhludoff rising, and their eyes meeting,
she turned red in the face and doubtfully, as it
seemed, shook her head.</p>

<p>"My business with you is the following," began Simonson,
when they reached the corridor. "Knowing your
relations toward Catherine Michaelovna," and he looked
straight into Nekhludoff's face, "I consider it my duty&mdash;&mdash;"
But at the very door two voices were shouting at
the same time.</p>

<p>"I tell you, heathen, they are not mine," shouted one
voice.</p>

<p>"Choke yourself, you devil!" the other said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>At that moment Maria Pablovna entered the corridor.</p>

<p>"You cannot talk here," she said. "Walk in here; only
Verotchka is there." And she opened the door of a tiny
cell, evidently intended for solitary confinement, and now
at the disposal of the political prisoners. On one of the
bunks lay Vera Efremovna, with her head covered.</p>

<p>"She is ill and asleep; she cannot hear you, and I will
go," said Maria Pablovna.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, stay here," said Simonson. "I keep
nothing secret, especially from you."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Maria Pablovna, and childishly moving
her whole body from side to side, and thus getting
into a snug corner of the bunks, she prepared to listen,
at the same time looking somewhere in the distance with
her beautiful, sheepish eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, then, knowing your relations toward Catherine
Michaelovna, I consider it my duty to let you know my
relations to her."</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said Nekhludoff, involuntarily admiring
Simonson's simplicity and straightforwardness.</p>

<p>"I wished to tell you that I would like to marry Catherine
Michaelovna&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Remarkable!" exclaimed Maria Pablovna, fixing her
gaze on Simonson.</p>

<p>"And I have decided to ask her to be my wife," continued
Simonson.</p>

<p>"What, then, can I do? It depends on her," said
Nekhludoff.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>"Yes; but she would not decide the matter without
you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, while the question of your relations remains
undecided, she cannot choose."</p>

<p>"On my part the question is definitely decided. I only
wished to do that which I considered it my duty to do,
and also to relieve her condition, but in no case did I
intend to influence her choice."</p>

<p>"Yes; but she does not wish your sacrifice."</p>

<p>"There is no sacrifice."</p>

<p>"And I also know that her decision is irrevocable."</p>

<p>"Why, then, talk to me?" said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"It is necessary for her that you should also approve
of it."</p>

<p>"I can only say that I am not free, but she is free to
do what she wishes."</p>

<p>Simonson began to ponder.</p>

<p>"Very well, I will tell her so. Do not think that I am
in love with her," he continued. "I admire her as a good,
rare person who has suffered much. I wish nothing from
her, but I would very much like to help her, to relieve
her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Simonson's trembling voice surprised Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"To relieve her condition," continued Simonson. "If
she does not wish to accept your help, let her accept mine.
If she consented, I would ask permission to join her in
prison. Four years is not an eternity. I would live near
her, and perhaps lighten her fate&mdash;&mdash;" His emotion
again compelled him to stop.</p>

<p>"What can I say?" said Nekhludoff. "I am glad that
she has found such a protector."</p>

<p>"That is just what I wanted to know," continued Simonson.
"I wished to know whether you, loving her and
seeking her good, could approve of her marrying me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Nekhludoff answered, decisively.</p>

<p>"It is all for her; all I wish is that that woman, who
had suffered so much, should have some rest," said Simonson,
with a childlike gentleness that no one would
expect from a man of such gloomy aspect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>Simonson rose, took Nekhludoff's hand, smiled bashfully
and embraced him.</p>

<p>"Well, I will so tell her," he said, and left the room.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-VII" id="CHAPTER_3-VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>"What do you think of him?" said Maria Pablovna.
"In love, and earnestly in love! I never thought that
Vladimir <a name="Simonson" id="Simonson"></a>Simonson could fall in love in such a very
stupid, childish fashion. It is remarkable, and to tell the
truth, sad," she concluded, sighing.</p>

<p>"But Katia? How do you think she will take it?"
asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"She?" Maria Pablovna stopped, evidently desiring to
give a precise answer. "She? You see, notwithstanding
her past, she is naturally of a most moral character.
And her feelings are so refined. She loves you&mdash;very
much so&mdash;and is happy to be able to do you the negative
good of not binding you to herself. Marriage with you
would be a dreadful fall to her, worse than all her past.
For this reason she would never consent to it. At the
same time, your presence perplexes her."</p>

<p>"Ought I then to disappear?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>Maria Pablovna smiled in her pleasant, childish way.</p>

<p>"Yes, partly."</p>

<p>"How can I partly disappear?"</p>

<p>"I take it back. But I will tell you that she probably
sees the absurdity of that exalted love of his (he has not
spoken to her about it), is flattered by it, and fears it.
You know that I am not competent in these matters, but
I think that his love is that of the ordinary man, although
it is masked. He says that it rouses his energy and that
it is a platonic love; but it has nothing but nastiness for
its basis."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"I think it is best that you have a talk with her. It is
always better to make everything clear. Shall I call
her?" said Maria Pablovna.</p>

<p>"If you please," answered Nekhludoff, and Maria Pablovna
went out.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff was seized with a strange feeling when,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>alone in the small cell, he listened to the quiet breathing
of Vera Efremovna, interrupted by an occasional moan,
and the constant din coming from the cells of the convicts.</p>

<p>That which Simonson had told him freed him from
his self-imposed obligation, which, in a moment of weakness,
seemed to him burdensome and dreadful; and yet it
was not only unpleasant, but painful. The offer of Simonson
destroyed the exclusiveness of his act, minimized
in his own and other people's eyes the value of the sacrifice
he was making. If such a good man as Simonson,
who was under no obligation to her, wished to join his
fate to hers, then his own sacrifice was no longer so important.
Maybe there was also the ordinary feeling of
jealousy; he was so used to her love that he could not
think that she was capable of loving any one else. Besides,
his plans were now shattered, especially the plan of
living near her while she served her sentence. If she
married Simonson, his presence was no longer necessary,
and that required a rearrangement of his projects. He
could scarcely collect his thoughts, when Katiousha entered
the cell.</p>

<p>With quick step she approached him.</p>

<p>"Maria Pablovna sent me," she said, stopping near
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would like to talk with you. Take a seat.
Vladimir Ivanovitch spoke to me."</p>

<p>She seated herself, crossed her hands on her knees, and
seemed calm. But as soon as Nekhludoff pronounced
Simonson's name, her face turned a purple color.</p>

<p>"What did he tell you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He told me that he wishes to marry you."</p>

<p>Her face suddenly became wrinkled, evidencing suffering,
but she remained silent, only looking at the floor.</p>

<p>"He asked my consent or advice. I told him that it
all rests with you; that you must decide."</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it all for?" she said, and looked at Nekhludoff
with that squinting glance that always peculiarly
affected him. For a few seconds they looked silently at
each other. That glance was significant to both.</p>

<p>"You must decide," repeated Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Decide what?" she said. "It has all been decided long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>ago. It is you who must decide whether you will accept
the offer of Vladimir Ivanovitch," she continued, frowning.</p>

<p>"But if a pardon should come?" said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Oh, leave me alone. It is useless to talk any more,"
she answered, and, rising, left the cell.</p>

<p>Gaining the street, Nekhludoff stopped, and, expanding
his chest, drew in the frosty air.</p>

<p>The following morning a soldier brought him a note
from Maria Pablovna, in which she said that Kryltzoff's
condition was worse than they thought it to be.</p>

<p>"At one time we intended to remain here with him, but
they would not allow it. So we are taking him with us,
but we fear the worst. Try to so arrange in town that
if he is left behind some one of us shall remain with him.
If it is necessary for that purpose that I should marry
him, then, of course, I am ready to do it."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff obtained horses and hastened to catch up
with the party of prisoners. He stopped his team near
the wagon carrying Kryltzoff on a bed of hay and pillows.
Beside Kryltzoff sat Maria Pablovna. Kryltzoff, in a
fur coat and lambskin cap, seemed thinner and more pale
than before. His beautiful eyes seemed particularly
larger and sparkling. Weakly rolling from side to side
from the jostling of the wagon, he steadily looked at
Nekhludoff, and in answer to questions about his health,
he only closed his eyes and angrily shook his head. It
required all his energy to withstand the jostling of the
wagon. Maria Pablovna exchanged glances with Nekhludoff,
expressing apprehension concerning Kryltzoff's
condition.</p>

<p>"The officer seems to have some shame in him," she
shouted, so as to be heard above the rattling of the wheels.
"He removed the handcuffs from Bouzovkin, who is now
carrying his child. With him are Katia, Simonson and,
in my place, Verotchka."</p>

<p>Kryltzoff, pointing at Maria Pablovna, said something
which could not, however, be heard. Nekhludoff leaned
over him in order to hear him. Then Kryltzoff removed
the handkerchief, which was tied around his mouth, and
whispered:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>"Now I am better. If I could only keep from catching
cold."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff nodded affirmatively and glanced at Maria
Pablovna.</p>

<p>"Have you received my note, and will you do it?" asked
Maria Pablovna.</p>

<p>"Without fail," said Nekhludoff, and seeing the dissatisfied
face of Kryltzoff, went over to his own team,
climbed into the wagon, and holding fast to the sides of it,
drove along the line of gray-coated and fettered prisoners
which stretched for almost a mile.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff crossed the river to a town, and his driver
took him to a hotel, where, notwithstanding the poor
appointments, he found a measure of comfort entirely
wanting in the inns of his stopping places. He took a
bath, dressed himself in city clothes and drove to the governor
of the district. He alighted at a large, handsome
building, in front of which stood a sentry and a policeman.</p>

<p>The general was ill, and did not receive. Nekhludoff,
nevertheless, asked the porter to take his card to the general,
and the porter returned with a favorable answer:</p>

<p>"You are asked to step in."</p>

<p>The vestibule, the porter, the messenger, the shining
floor of the hall&mdash;everything reminded him of St. Petersburg,
only it was somewhat dirtier and more majestic.
Nekhludoff was admitted to the cabinet.</p>

<p>The general, bloated, with a potato nose and prominent
bumps on his forehead, hairless pate and bags under
his eyes, a man of sanguine temperament, was reclining
in a silk morning gown, and with a cigarette in his hand,
was drinking tea from a silver saucer.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir? Excuse my receiving you in a
morning gown; it is better than not receiving at all," he
said, covering his stout, wrinkled neck with the collar of
his gown. "I am not quite well, and do not go out.
What brought you into these wilds?"</p>

<p>"I was following a party of convicts, among whom is a
person near to me," said Nekhludoff. "And now I come
to see Your Excellency about that person, and also another
affair."</p>

<p>The general inhaled the smoke of his cigarette, took a
sip of tea, placed his cigarette in a malachite ash-holder,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>and steadily gazing with his watery, shining eyes at Nekhludoff,
listened gravely. He only interrupted Nekhludoff
to ask him if he wished to smoke.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff told the general that the person in whom
he was interested was a woman, that she was unjustly
convicted, and that His Majesty's clemency had been appealed
to.</p>

<p>"Yes. Well?" said the general.</p>

<p>"I was promised in St. Petersburg that the news of
this woman's fate would be sent to this place not later
than this month."</p>

<p>Looking steadily at Nekhludoff, the general asked:</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"My second request would be concerning the political
prisoner who is going to Siberia with this detachment."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the general.</p>

<p>"He is very sick&mdash;he is a dying man. And he will
probably be left here in the hospital; for this reason one
of the female prisoners would like to remain with him."</p>

<p>"Is she a relative of his?"</p>

<p>"No. But she wishes to marry him, if it will allow her
to stay with him."</p>

<p>The general looked sharply at Nekhludoff from his
shining eyes, and, smoking continually, he kept silence,
as if wishing to confound his companion.</p>

<p>When Nekhludoff had finished he took a book from
the table, and frequently wetting the fingers with which
he turned the leaves, he lighted on the chapter treating of
marriage and perused it.</p>

<p>"What's her sentence?" he asked, lifting his eyes from
the book.</p>

<p>"Hers? Hard labor."</p>

<p>"If this is the case, the sentence cannot be changed by
marriage."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon! If a free man would marry her
she would have to serve her sentence all the same. Whose
sentence is harder, his or hers?"</p>

<p>"Both are sentenced to hard labor."</p>

<p>"So they are quits," the general said, laughing. "An
equal share for both of them. He may be left here on
account of his sickness," he continued, "and, of course,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>everything will be done to ameliorate his condition, but
she, even if she should marry him, cannot remain here.
Anyhow, I will think it over. What are their names?
Write them down here."</p>

<p>Nekhludoff did as he was asked.</p>

<p>"And this I cannot do either," said the general, concerning
his request to see the patient. "Of course I don't
suspect you, but you are interested in them and in others.
You have money, and the people here are corrupt. How,
then, is it possible for me to watch a person who is five
thousand miles distant from me? There he is king, as I
am here," and he began to laugh. "You have surely seen
the political prisoners. You have surely given them
money," he added, smiling. "Isn't it so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true."</p>

<p>"I understand that you must act in this way. You
want to see the political prisoner, and you all sorrow for
him, and the soldier on guard will surely take money, because
he has a family, and his salary amounts to something
less than nothing; he cannot afford to refuse. I
would do the same were I in yours or his place. But,
being situated as I am now, I cannot permit myself to
disobey one iota of the law, for the very reason that I,
too, am no more than a man, and am liable to yield to
pity. They confide in me under certain conditions, and
I, by my actions, must prove that I am trustworthy. So
this question is settled. Well, now tell me what is going
on at the metropolis?"</p>

<p>Then the general put various questions, as if he would
like to learn some news.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me now whom you are stopping with&mdash;at
Duke's? It is unpleasant there. Come to us to dinner,"
he said, finally, dismissing Nekhludoff, "at five. Do you
speak English?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, that is good. You see, there is an English traveler
here. He is studying the exile system, and the
prisons in Siberia. So he will dine with us, and you
come, too. We dine at five, and madam wants us to be
punctual. I will let you know what will be done with
that woman, and also with the patient. Maybe it will
be possible to leave somebody with him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>Having taken leave of the general, Nekhludoff drove
to the postoffice. Receiving his mail, he walked up
to a wooden bench, on which a soldier was sitting,
probably waiting for something; he sat down beside
him, and started to look through the letters.
Among them he found a registered letter in a beautiful,
large envelope, with a large seal of red wax on it.
He tore open the envelope, and, seeing a letter from <a name="Silenin2" id="Silenin2"></a>Selenin
with some official document, he felt the blood mounting
to his cheeks, and his heart grow weak. This document
was the decision concerning Katiousha's trial. What
was it? Was it possible that it contained a refusal?
Nekhludoff hastily ran over the letter, written in small,
hardly legible, broken handwriting, and breathed freely.
The decision was a favorable one.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," wrote <a name="Silenin3" id="Silenin3"></a>Selenin, "our last conversation
made a strong impression upon me. You were right concerning
Maslova. I have looked through the accusation.
This could be corrected only through the Commission
for Petitions, to which you sent your petition. They let
me have a copy of the pardon, and here I send it to you,
to the address which the Countess Catherine Ivanovna
gave me. I press your hand in friendship."</p>

<p>The news was pleasant and important. All that Nekhludoff
could wish for Katiousha and himself was realized.
True, those changes in his life changed his relations to
her. But now, he thought, all that was most important
was to see her as quick as possible and bring her the good
news of her freedom. He thought that the copy he had
in his hand was sufficient for that. So he bade the cabman
drive at once to the prison.</p>

<p>The superintendent of the prison told him that he could
not admit him without a permit from the general. The
copy of the petition from their majesty's bureau also did
not prevail with the superintendent. He positively refused
admittance. He also refused to admit him to see
Kryltzoff.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-VIII" id="CHAPTER_3-VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>After the disappointment at the prison, Nekhludoff
drove down to the Governor's Bureau to find out whether
they had received there any news concerning the pardon
of Maslova. There was no news there, so he drove back
to his hotel, and wrote at once to the lawyer and to <a name="Selenin" id="Selenin"></a>Selenin
concerning it. Having finished the letters, he glanced at
his watch; it was already time to go to the general.</p>

<p>On the way he thought again of how he might hand
over the pardon to Katiousha; of the place she would be
sent to, and how he would live with her.</p>

<p>At dinner in the general's house all were not only very
friendly to Nekhludoff, but, as it seemed, very favorably
inclined to him, as he was a new, interesting personality.
The general, who came in to dinner with a white cross on
his breast, greeted Nekhludoff like an old friend. On the
general's inquiry as to what he had done since he saw
him in the morning, Nekhludoff answered that he had
been at the postoffice, that he had found out the facts
concerning the pardoning of the person they were talking
of in the morning, and he asked permission to visit her.</p>

<p>The general seemed displeased, began to frown and
said nothing.</p>

<p>"Will you have some whisky?" he said in French to
the Englishman who had walked up to him. The Englishman
took some, and related that he had been to see
the cathedral of the city, and the factory, and expressed
the desire to see the great jail in which criminals were
confined on their way to Siberia.</p>

<p>"This idea is excellent!" exclaimed the general, turning
to Nekhludoff. "You may go together. Give them
a pass!" he added, turning to his lieutenant.</p>

<p>"What time do you wish to go?" Nekhludoff asked the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"I prefer to visit prisons in the evening," the Englishman
replied. "All are then at home, and there are no
preparations."</p>

<p>After dinner, Nekhludoff followed her into the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>ante-chamber,
where the Englishman was already waiting for
him to visit the prison, as they had agreed. Having taken
leave of the whole family, he walked out, followed by
the Englishman.</p>

<p>The sombre looking prison, the soldier on guard, the
lantern behind the gate, notwithstanding the pure white
layer of snow which had covered everything&mdash;the sidewalk,
the roof and the walls&mdash;made a gloomy impression.
The proud looking superintendent, walking out to the
gate and glancing at Nekhludoff's pass in the light of
the lantern, shrugged his broad shoulders, but obeyed the
order and invited the visitors to follow him. He first led
them to the yard, and then to a door on the right hand
and up the stairs leading to the office. Offering them
seats, he asked them in what way he could serve them,
and learning from Nekhludoff that he wished to see Maslova,
he sent the jailer for her and prepared himself to
answer the questions which the Englishman wished to
ask him, before going to the cell.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff translated the Englishman's questions.
While they were conversing they heard approaching footsteps,
the door opened and the jailer entered, followed
by Katiousha in her prison garb, with a scarf tied around
her head.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff rose and made a few steps toward her. She
said nothing, but her excited expression surprised him.
Her face was lit up with a wonderful decision. He had
never seen her look like that. Now the blood rushed to
her face, and now she turned pale; now her fingers twisted
convulsively the edges of her jacket, now she looked at
him, and now she dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>"You know what I called you for?" asked Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me. But now I am decided. I will ask
permission to go with Vladimir Ivanovitch." She said
this quickly, as if she had made up her mind before what
to say.</p>

<p>"How with Vladimir Ivanovitch?" asked Nekhludoff.
But she interrupted him.</p>

<p>"But if he wants me to live with him?" Here she
stopped in fear, and added, "I mean to stay with him. I
could expect nothing better, and perhaps I may be useful
to him and others. What difference does it make to me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>One of the two things had happened&mdash;either she had
fallen in love with Simonson and did not wish his sacrifice,
which weighed so heavily on him, or she was still in
love with Nekhludoff and renounced him for his own
good, burning all bridges behind her, and throwing her
fortunes in the same scale with those of Simonson.
Nekhludoff understood it, and felt ashamed.</p>

<p>"If you are in love with him," he said.</p>

<p>"I never knew such people, you know. It is impossible
not to love them. And Vladimir is entirely unlike
any person I have ever known."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said Nekhludoff. "He is an excellent
man, and I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she interrupted him, as if she were afraid that
he would speak too much, or she would not say everything.</p>

<p>"You will forgive me for doing that which you did not
wish. You, too, must love."</p>

<p>She said the very thing that he had just said to himself.</p>

<p>But now he was no longer thinking so, but felt altogether
different. He felt not only shame, but pity.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that all is at an end between us?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, it looks like it," she answered, with a strange
smile.</p>

<p>"But nevertheless I would like to be useful to you."</p>

<p>"To us," she said, glancing at Nekhludoff. "We don't
need anything. I am very much obliged to you. If it
were not for you"&mdash;she wished to say something, but her
voice began to tremble.</p>

<p>"I don't know which of us is under greater obligation
to the other. God will settle our accounts," said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>"Yes, God will settle them," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" asked the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Directly," answered Nekhludoff, and then he inquired
of her what she knew of Kryltzoff.</p>

<p>She quieted down and calmly told him:</p>

<p>"Kryltzoff became very weak on the road and was taken
to the hospital. Maria Pablovna wanted to become a
nurse, but there is no answer yet."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>"Well, may I go?" she asked, noticing the Englishman
who was waiting for him.</p>

<p>"I am not yet taking leave of you," said Nekhludoff,
holding out his hand to her.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," she said in a low tone.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and in that strange, stern look, and in
that pitiful smile, with which she said not "good-by," but
"pardon me," Nekhludoff understood, that of the two suppositions
concerning her decision the latter was the right
one. She still loved him and thought she would mar his
life by a union with him, and would free him by living
with Simonson.</p>

<p>She pressed his hand, turned quickly, and left the room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-IX" id="CHAPTER_3-IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Passing through the hall and the ill-smelling corridors,
the superintendent passed into the first building of the
prison in which those condemned to hard labor were confined.
Entering the first room in that building they
found the prisoners stretched on their berths, which occupied
the middle of the room. Hearing the visitors enter
they all jumped down, and, clinking their chains, placed
themselves beside their berths, while their half-shaven
heads were distinctly set off against the gloom of the
prison. Only two of the prisoners remained at their
places. One of them was a young man whose face was
evidently heated with fever; the other was an old man,
who never left off groaning.</p>

<p>The Englishman asked whether the young man had
been sick for a long time. The superintendent replied
that he had been taken sick that very same morning, that
the old man had had convulsions for a long time, and that
they kept him in prison because there was no place for him
in the hospital.</p>

<p>The Englishman shook his head discontentedly, said
that he would like to say a few words to the prisoners, and
asked Nekhludoff to translate his remarks. It turned out
that, besides the aim of his journey, which was the description
of the exile system&mdash;he had another one&mdash;the
preaching of the gospel, of salvation through faith.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>"Tell them that Christ pitied and loved them," he said
to Nekhludoff, "and that He died for them. He who will
believe in Him will be saved."</p>

<p>While he was saying this, all the prisoners were standing
erect with their hands by their sides.</p>

<p>"Tell them," continued the Englishman, "that all I said
will be found in this book. Are there any among them
who can read?" It turned out that there were more than
twenty who could.</p>

<p>The Englishman took out a few leather-bound Bibles
from his traveling bag, and soon a number of muscular
hands, terminating in long black nails, were stretched out
toward him, pushing each other aside in order to reach the
Testaments. He left two Testaments in this room, and
went to the next one.</p>

<p>There the same thing occurred. There prevailed the
same dampness and ill-smells. But in this room, between
the windows, an image of the Virgin, before which a
small lamp burned dimly, was hung up. To the left side
of the door stood the large vat. Here the prisoners were
stretched out on their berths, and in the same way they
rose and placed themselves in a row. Three of them remained
in their places. Two of these three lifted themselves
and sat up, but the third one remained stretched
out, and did not even look at the visitors. These latter
ones were sick. The Englishman addressed them in the
same manner, and left two Testaments.</p>

<p>From the cells in which those condemned to hard labor
were imprisoned, they passed over to the cells of the exiles,
and finally those in which the relatives who escorted
the prisoners to Siberia were awaiting the day appointed
to start hence.</p>

<p>Everywhere the same cold, hungry, idling, sickly, degraded,
brutalized human beings could be seen.</p>

<p>The Englishman distributed his Bibles, and, being tired
out, he walked through the rooms saying "All right" to
whatever the superintendent told him concerning the prisons.</p>

<p>They went out into the corridor.</p>

<p>The Englishman, pointing to an open door, asked what
that room was for.</p>

<p>"This is the prison morgue."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>"Oh!" exclaimed the Englishman, and he expressed a
desire to enter. This room was an ordinary room. A
small lamp, fastened to the wall, lit up the four bodies
which were stretched on berths, with their heads toward
the wall and the feet protruding toward the door. The
first body, in a plain shirt, was that of a tall young man,
with a small, pointed beard and half-shaven head. The
corpse was already chilled, and its blue hands were folded
over the breast. Beside him, in a white dress and jacket,
lay a bare-footed old woman, with thin hair and wrinkled,
yellowish face. Beside this old woman lay a corpse, attired
in blue.</p>

<p>This color recalled something in Nekhludoff's memory.</p>

<p>"And who is this third one?" he asked, mistrusting his
own eyesight.</p>

<p>"This one is a gentleman who was sent hither from the
hospital," replied the superintendent.</p>

<p>Nekhludoff walked up to the body and touched the icy
cold feet of Kryltzoff.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3-X" id="CHAPTER_3-X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>Nekhludoff, after parting with the Englishman, went
straight to his hotel, and walked about his room for a long
time. The affair with Katiousha was at an end. There
was something ugly in the very memory of it. But it was
not that which grieved him. Some other affair of his was
yet unsettled&mdash;an affair which tortured him and required
his attention. In his imagination rose the gloomy scenes
of the hundreds and thousands of human beings pent up
in the pestiferous air. The laughter of the prisoners resounded
in his ears. He saw again among the dead bodies
the beautiful, angry, waxen face of the dead Kryltzoff; and
the question whether he was mad, or all those who commit
those evils and think themselves wise were mad, bore
in upon his mind with renewed power, and he found no
answer to it. The principal difficulty consisted in finding
an answer to the principal question, which was: What
should be done with those who became brutalized in the
struggle for life?</p>

<p>When he became tired walking about the room he sat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>down on the lounge, close by the lamp, and mechanically
opened the Bible which the Englishman had presented
him, and which he had thrown on the table while
emptying his pockets. They say, he thought, that this
Bible contains the solution to all questions. So, opening
it, he began to read at the place at which it opened itself&mdash;Matt.
x., 8. After a while he inclined close to the lamp
and became like one petrified. An exultation, the like of
which he had not experienced for a long time, took possession
of his soul, as though, after long suffering and
weariness, he found at last liberty and rest. He did not
sleep the whole night. As is the case with many who
read the Bible for the first time, he now, on reading it
again, grasped the full meaning of words which he had
known long ago, but which he had not understood before.
Like a sponge that absorbs everything, so he absorbed
everything that was important, necessary and joyful.</p>

<p>"That is the principal thing," thought Nekhludoff.
"We all live in the silly belief that we ourselves are the
lords of our world, that this world has been given us for
our enjoyment. But this is evidently untrue. Somebody
must have sent us here for some reason. And for this
reason it is plain that we will suffer like those laborers
suffer who do not fulfill the wishes of their Master. The
will of the Lord is expressed in the teachings of Christ.
Let man obey Him, and the Kingdom of the Lord will
come on earth, and man will derive the greatest possible
good.</p>

<p>"<i>Seek the truth and the Kingdom of God, and the rest
will come of itself.</i> We seek that which is to come, and
do not find it, and not only do we not build the Kingdom
of God, but we destroy it.</p>

<p>"So this will henceforth be the task of my life!"</p>

<p>And indeed, from that night a new life began for
Nekhludoff; not so much because he had risen into a new
stage of existence, but because all that had happened to
him till then assumed for him an altogether new meaning.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
